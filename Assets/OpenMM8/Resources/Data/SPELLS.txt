It acts much like a fireball, striking its target and exploding out to hit everything near it, except the explosion does much more damage than most fireballs.	n/a	Damage 10 points plus 1-10 points per point of skill	Damage 11 points plus 1-11 points per point of skill	Damage 12 points plus 1-12 points per point of skill	P	10	10	10	10	100	100	100	100	21010	12010	12011	0	0
124	3	Flight	none	Flight	Allows the Dragon to carry the party in flight.  This ability is expensive and only works outdoors, but it is very useful.
