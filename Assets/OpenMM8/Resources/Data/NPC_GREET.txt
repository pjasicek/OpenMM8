#	Greeting 1	Greeting 2	Notes	Owner
1	"I'm glad I found you! Of all the other guards, you are the only one I've seen! Regnan Pirates attack the island. We must inform the caravan master, Dadeross. He's visiting the village chieftain. Find him! I'll return to the wagons to guard them."	Have you spoken with Dadeross?  What are we to do now?		S'ton
2	Greetings Journeyman!  I have been speaking with Brekish Onefang about the predicament that we find ourselves in. The Clan Leader may know of a way to get off these islands and return to Ravenshore	Have you found a way off the islands?  Are the waters safe for us to sail back to Ravenshore?		Dadeross
3	"Welcome to Dagger Wound Island, Journeyman of Alvar.  I am Brekish Onefang, Clan Leader.  I wish I was greeting you during better times.

The mountain of fire has caused serious damage to my village and its people.  Many buildings have been damaged, and the bridges that connect the smaller islands to the main island have been destroyed!  Many people are missing or stranded on these smaller islands!  We must help them!"	Have the Portals been fixed?  My stranded people are able to return to the safety of the village here on the main island?		Brekish Onefang
4	You must tell the Merchants of Alvar of the Regnan raid on Dagger Wound Island!  They must send help!	"We are in debt to you!  Not only did you save my stranded people, but you also returned to stop the Regnan assault upon my island!"		Brekish Onefang
5	What?  I don't have time to talk now!  I need to pack some things and leave!	Be quick with your business. I must prepare to escape these islands!		Fredrick Talimere
6	Aren't you with the Merchant Caravan from Alvar?  I need your help!	The mountain of fire will surely destroy us!		Rohtnax
7	It's the end of the world!  The Mountain of Fire will consume us all!	It's the end of the world!  The Mountain of Fire will consume us all!		Pascella Tisk
8	What are you doing here? Get my letter to Fellmoon!	What are you doing here? Get my letter to Fellmoon!		
9	"Welcome aboard!  May you have smooth, swift seas!"	"Welcome aboard!  May you have smooth, swift seas!"		
10	Welcome to the Ravenshore guildhouse of the Merchants of Alvar. I am Elgar Fellmoon. How may I help you?	Yes?		Elgar Fellmoon NPC 3
11	Have you done as I've asked of you?	Have you done as I've asked of you?		Elgar Fellmoon NPC 3
12	"Okay…you've beaten my guards. Truce.

I'm Arion Hunter. I suppose you could call this all my operation. What do you want?"	What is it now?		Arion Hunter
13	Halt! None may pass into the inner chambers unless accompanied by a guild member.	Halt! None may pass into the inner chambers unless accompanied by a guild member.		Necromancer Guild Guard
14	"Welcome to the Guildhouse of the Merchants of Alvar. I am Bastian Loudrin, the high guildmaster. From here we run the Alvarian trade empire."	Welcome back to the Guildhouse of the Merchants of Alvar.		Bastian Loudrin
15	"We have identified those we believe would join an alliance to stand against the crisis. These are: the Minotaurs of Ravage Roaming, the Clerics of the Temple of the Sun in Murmurwoods, the Dragons of Garrote Gorge, the Necromancers' Guild in Shadowspire, and Charles Quixote's Dragon hunting camp in Garrote Gorge.

Now none of us believe that you can get all of them to work together, but with us and the Trolls already with the alliance, it should suffice if three of the five join us.

Perhaps you should begin by speaking with Sahil Ittalle who lives at the north end of the town. He is our guild's historian and the best person to brief you on our potential allies' various dispositions."	Good day.		Bastian Loudrin
16	"I am Overdune, I hunt meat for the village of Rust. Or I did so before the lake of fire came to destroy our homes."	You are back. How goes it with you?		Overdune Snapfinger
17	"Leave me be. I morn the death of Vilebite, my son."	"Leave me be. I morn the death of Vilebite, my son."		OVERDUNE'S FATHER
18	Th-thank you for giving my son Vilebite his rest.	Come in…you are always welcome here.		OVERDUNE'S FATHER
19	"It is only because you are under Bastian Loudrin's protection that I have allowed you this audience. Know you stand before Deftclaw Redreaver, Ultimate Flightleader of the Dragons of Jadame. I am not to be tarried with. Speak your business!"	You disturb me again? This had best be important.		Deftclaw Redreaver NPC 21
20	What do you want?	What do you want?		Deftclaw Redreaver NPC 21
21	"Sir Charles Quixote at your service. Welcome to my camp headquarters. From here I oversee this hunting expedition.

Are you here to trade? Most of what my goods are committed to orders already. I do, however, have some baby dragons for sale. And I suppose I could part with some of the lower grade adult hides."	How may I help you?		CharlesQuixote NPC 19
22	"You just caught me. I'm almost ready to leave for Ravenshore, but how may I help you?"	"You just caught me. I'm almost ready to leave for Ravenshore, but how may I help you?"		Charles Quixote NPC 19
23	"It was a long journey, but here I am. Good to see you again."	How are you?		Charles Quixote NPC 65
24	Hail the alliance! How goes it with you?	Welcome!		Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53
25	And so I have made haste to Ravenshore. Already I grow weary of life among the prey animals. You had best be quick about the business of this alliance!	"Well, what is it?"		Deftclaw Redreaver NPC 66
26	It has been a long time since I have traveled. I forget how beautiful parts of this land can be. I look forward to resolving the current crisis--the very least reason being that I can then take a long deserved sabbatical.	Yes?		Oskar Tyre NPC 67
27	"It is good to see you again, friends. Thanks to you, things go well at Balthazar Lair. Already my herd has made great progress towards restoring our homes and shops. Perhaps you have visited the restored city?"	"Greetings, friends."		Masul NPC 68
28	"Things go well for us in our war against the Temple of the Sun. Before I left, I saw the Shadowspire border made secure. Daily our troops force theirs back to their main temple in Murmurwoods.

Again, on behalf of the Necromancers' Guild, I thank you. Now, let us get on with the business at hand."	"Hello, guild friends."		Sandro NPC 69
29	"Greetings. I am Masul, Herdmaster of Balthazar Lair. On behalf of my herd, I thank you for saving us. I was sure that we were destined to perish. Now it seems we will survive. I look forward to rebuilding our lair."	How may I serve the saviors of my herd?		Masul NPC 13
30	"Wha…who is it? Who is it! You may think my injuries make me easy prey raiders! But know my axe is sharp, and…and…hey…

You're not the raiders! Who are you?"	"Hello, again."		MINOTAUR CLUE GUY
31	"Hail to you. I am Sandro. Thant and I are the high guildmasters of the Necromancers' Guild. With our fortunes diminished in Erathia and Enroth, it could be argued that we speak for the guild worldwide.

We have heard that you are envoys from Bastian Loudrin. What is his need of us?"	What is it? Be quick! We are very busy.		Sandro NPC 9
32	"Hah! The only advantage that the Sun Temple had against us is no more. With the Nightshade Brazier back in our possession, we no longer need worry about the daytime defense of Shadowspire. We can march our undead to their very doors. We will destroy their temple and wipe them from the face of Jadame! 

Now that the tide of battle has turned in our favor, we of the Necromancers' Guild can more generously consider the request made by our friend, Bastian Loudrin. Thant can take over here while I am away sitting on your alliance council."	Yes?		Sandro NPC 9
33	"Who are you? I don't recognize you, but I'm sure that whatever your business, it will add to my troubles."	What do you want?		Dyson Leland NPC 11
34	"So, Sandro has asked you to strike a blow against the Sun Temple! Though I hate the guild. I would be willing to help you. Half a serving of revenge is better than none."	"So, do we move against the Sun Temple? Shall we get for Sandro his Nightshade Brazier?"		Dyson Leland NPC 11
35	"Ah, you are sent by his high holiness…Oskar Tyre thinks to activate his agent. Though I would wish him no good, I will do as he asks. Yes, I have knowledge of the guild's Skeleton Transformer and believe I can destroy it. Very well, let us do this thing against the Necromancers' Guild. I will at least be able to strike against one of my enemies!"	Are you now ready to destroy the guild's Skeleton Transformer? I will join you and we can be about the task!		Dyson Leland NPC 11
36	"Hah! So both Sandro and Oskar Tyre seek to use me against the other. I have thought of the possibility of this occurring. I believe that if I were to strike against one, it would become impossible for me to strike the other.

So I guess we have a choice--help the guild or the temple. Which? I don't know, as my hatred for both is equal. I suppose I'll have to do with a half measure of revenge."	"So, have you decided to steal the Nightshade Brazier from the Temple, or to destroy the guild's Skeleton Transformer? Either way…I will join you. But let us do it. I would slack my thirst for revenge."		Dyson Leland NPC 11
37	"So you are sent by Bastian Loudrin? Well, then. What would he have us hear?"	The Light upon you. What need you of our temple?		Oskar Tyre NPC 37
38	"Hail, heroes of Jadame! I'm glad you’ve returned. I want to make it clear that the merchant guild has made this guildhouse permanently open to you. 

Now that the crisis is over, the other council members have returned home. Though they are gone, good will prevails between us. The beginning of a new era of peace? We will see. Certainly it is a time of prosperity! Our caravans are already back in operation."	"Hail, Heroes of Jadame!"		Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53
39	"Ah well, very good to see you. Quite a lot of trouble is behind us, no? What brings the ""Heroes of Jadame"" to my camp?"	Hello again.		Charles Quixote NPC 65
40	"Together we have done a great deed. I look forward to telling my heir the tale. How can I help you, heroes?"	Welcome. My cave is open to you.		Deftclaw Redreaver NPC 66
41	"The Light has shined upon us indeed. Our temple is always open to the ""Heroes of Jadame."" How may I help you?"	"Yes, friends?"		Oskar Tyre NPC 67
42	How good of you to grace us with your presence. Heroes of Jadame. Saviors of Balthazar Lair. Both fitting titles for you who have done so much for me herd and for all of Jadame!	"Hail, Saviors of Balthazar Lair!"		Masul NPC 68
43	"Hail! In the name of the guild, I welcome you. Know that we consider you our friends, Heroes of Jadame. What would you have of us today?"	"Greetings, heroes."		Sandro NPC 69
44	"If you're looking for my master, Xanthor, he is not here. Can I help you?"	Can I help you?		XANTHOR'S LACKEY NPC 77
45	"Hmph. So you are the heroes of the alliance. Not much to look at, I must say. Still, I suppose you have survived much to see this day. I only hope you are up to the task I think fate has for you. If not, we are all surely doomed!"	You are back? Have you need of advice? Or are you finding the task at hand too difficult?		XANTHOR NPC 23
46	"There. It is built. Take this Conflux Key. As I have explained, it will allow you to use the crystal in the town square as a gateway--much as you've used the elemental gateways to reach the elemental planes. The crystal gateway will take you to the place between the planes.

On this ""Plane Between Planes"" you must find the source of the cataclysm. What it is, I don't know, but whatever it is, it is there. Go now! The fate of the land, I'm afraid, lies on your shoulders. Be worthy of the task!"	You must go through the crystal gateway! It leads to the plane between planes. The cause of the cataclysm lies through it--seek out the source!		XANTHOR NPC 23
47	"You have conducted yourselves greatly. I must say I had my doubts about your abilities, but no longer. You are truly worthy of the praise that all lavish upon you."	"How can I help you, friends?"		XANTHOR NPC 23
48	"I sense some small presence in this chamber. Greater than gnats, but so much less than myself. Where is it….

Ah, there it is. What have we here? Some of the beings of Jadame? Yes. Destroy them? Surely within my rights…but, no. It has been a slow millennia. Perhaps they will provide some diversion.

Speak then, lower ones! What would you have of Escaton the Destroyer of Worlds?"	"Ah the gnatlings are returned. I must consider why I allow them their continued existence. But this I will do some other time.

Speak then, while you still may, puny ones."		Escaton
49	Greetings.  You seek instruction?	Good day.  You seek to gain knowledge?		
50	Who is there? Am I finally to be released?	Are you here to free me?		
51	"Help me! I have been able to live thus far, but for how much longer can I?"	Will you now release me from my torment?		
52	"Ah, mortals…good. You are not of my tormentors. Release me from this place! I will not harm you."	"Release me from this cell, mortals!"		
53	"Free me quickly! I have survived so far, but it is only a matter of time before I am extinguished!"	My fires dampen. Release me!		
54	"Greetings. I am Sahil Ittalle, the historian of the Alvarian Merchant Guild. How can I help you today?"	Yes? Can I help you?		Sahil Ittalle
55	"Ah, you must be the alliance council's heroes. Well met. Catherine and I are here to help. What can I do for you?"	Greetings!		Roland Ironfist
56	"It was a harrowing journey to reach your shores, I assure you! But the events of the cataclysm force all to extreme duties. I'm sure you understand. But down to issues. How can I help you?"	Yes?		Catherine Ironfist
57	"Greetings! I am Asael Fromago, the world's preeminent connoisseur of fine cheeses. Oh, some might say that Elkanah Juusto of Edenbrook holds the title, but he is a dilettante--a mere dabbler!"	"Greetings! How may Asael Fromago, master of cheeses, serve you?"		Asael Fromago
58	"Hail, adventurer!"	"Hail, adventurer!"		Various
59	Yeah? What do you want?	Yeah? What do you want?		"Aznog Black, NPC 409"
60	How are you today?	How are you today?		Various
61	Yes? What is it?	Yes? What is it?		Bazalath NPC 443
62	Greetings. How may I help you?	Greetings. How may I help you?		Various
63	Who are you? Clearly you are not of this realm. And how have you survived? I am amazed you have not been destroyed by the madness that has taken over my fellow earth dwellers!	Good to see you again.		
64	"Greetings. Though I have not yet succumbed to the madness, be aware! I feel its tug on my mind. I don't know how long I can hold out."	Hello again. You are still safe in my presence. The madness has not overtaken me.		
65	"The madness pulls at me, but still I maintain my sanity. If you have business with me, speak quickly. Even now I feel a compulsion to attack you!"	"I am still in my own mind, but for how long I don't know. What do you want?"		
66	"Fear not, plane-travelers. For reasons I do not understand, the madness that affects my brethren does not affect me. How can I help you?"	Yes?		
67	"Madness reigns these watery realms, but it does not rule me. Somehow I am not affected. How can I help you?"	How can I help you?		
68	"T-the madness p-pulls at my very soul. Each day is a st-struggle to maintain sanity. I w-will h-help you while I c-can, but be prepared to fl-flee!"	I s-still maintain my-myself. W-what is it y-you want?		
69	Welcome to my sanctuary. I have proofed this chamber against the maddening magic which affects my fellow citizens. You are safe as long as you stay here. How may I help you?	How can I help you?		
70	"I don't know what has befallen us, but it is awful! All my friends and family are affected by violent madness. Somehow I am not affected. But how can I help you?"	Hello again.		
71	"So, I understand you're out for adventure. I'd be glad to join you!"	Welcome back! Have you decided to take me with you in your travels?		Arius NPC 454
72	"It is so boring around here! I mean, why did I spend all that time training if I'm not going to use my skills? Say, perhaps you could take me with you. Clearly you're headed someplace exciting!"	"So, have you come back to take me on your adventure?"		Rohani Oscelton NPC 455
73	"I know the elder Dragons would never approve, but I don't care! I want adventure, and you're the best chance I'll see. Can I go with you?"	"So, can I come with you now? Can I?"		Ithilgore NPC 457
74	"Would you believe the Necromancers' Guild cast me out? I, Karanya Memoria? Fah! They were just jealous of my great potential. Not that this has stopped me from seeking dark knowledge--I do so now by my own path.

Say, perhaps we could join forces!"	Hello.		Karanya Memoria NPC 458
75	"Greetings, travelers! Ah, how I envy your lives of adventure. You know, I too know the call of the open road. I myself once sought new experiences--strange lands, strange people, and whatnot. Sadly, those days are over for me."	Good to see you again!		Maylander NPC 459
76	"Greetings, and well met! I am Jasp Thelbourne--an Elf of daring deeds. This is no idle boast. You may have heard of the Idol of Seven Skunks? It was I who recovered it from the Temple of Eep for the Alvarian Merchant Guild."	"Hello, again. How can Jasp Thelbourne, renowned adventurer do for you?"		Jasp Thelbourne NPC 463
77	"I grow weary of the endless demands placed on my by my so-called ""master,"" the accursed Thant. He would have me stay here in Shadowspire as a guard. A ""guard,"" feh! I am meant for greater things. An adventure like yours is what I seek. Will you have me in your fellowship?"	"Well, I'm still here, but I make preparations to leave as soon as an opportunity presents itself. Have you reconsidered? Will you take me now?"		Gethric Mercutura NPC 464
78	"Greetings. I am Nathaniel Roberts. Without false modesty, I can say I am a mighty master of dark magic. It is your good fortune I have grown bored of Shadowspire and seek a company of adventurers such as yourselves to ally myself with. If you are agreeable, I will allow you to accompany me."	"So, you have reconsidered my offer. Will you now agree to become my followers?"		Nathanial Roberts NPC 482
79	"So, a party of ""adventurers""…hmmm. I suppose most dragons would just attack them outright, but then again I, Flamdring, have never been ""most dragons,"" no. Join them? Yes, perhaps I will. Perhaps I will."	"Ah the adventurers return. Again the question arises: To join them or no? Yes, perhaps so…"		Flamdring NPC 465
80	"How are you? I am Hevatia Deverbero, a member in full standing of the Necromancers' Guild."	"Hello, again."		Hevatia Deverbero NPC 466
81	"Greetings, and may the Light shine on you. What can a humble priest of the Sun do for you today?"	Hello again. May the Light shine on you.		Verish NPC 467
82	"Yes? Well, don't stand there tongue tied! I'm a busy man!"	What do you want?		Nelix Uriel NPC 468
83	"Hello, and good hunting to you. I am Sethrc Thistlebone, a warrior of this village, such as it is."	"Hello, and good hunting!"		Sethrc Thistlebone NPC 469

85	"Greeting! I am Adric Stellare, a former lieutenant of the Alvar Guard. I grew tired of the regimented lifestyle. Now I seek adventure."	Greetings!		Adric Stellare NPC 471
86	"I am Infaustus, elder vampire and adventurer. I will talk with you if you are brief. I am busy making preparations to leave. I go to seek my fortune across the lands of Jadame."	Yes?		Infaustus NPC 472
87	"Very impressive performance. Reaching me was not easy. Perhaps you are the adventurers I seek. You see, I wish to explore the world, and these days, even a Dragon would be smart not to travel alone."	Yes?		Brimstone NPC 473
88	"Hail, adventurers! I am Tempus, hunt leader and a knight of some renown in my native Erathia. What can I do for you?"	Hail!		Tempus NPC 476
89	"Greetings! I am the mighty Thorne Understone. I know we have not met before--I never forget a face--but perhaps you recognize my name from ballads. You know, several have been written about me."	Hello again. What can the mighty Thorne do for you? Maybe I could sign my name on your shield as a keepsake. A lot of my fans seem to like that sort of thing.		Thorne Understone NPC 477
90	"Hail! I am Ulbrecht, a hero of the Vori campaigns. Be welcome in my home."	It is good to see you again.		Ulbrecht NPC 478
91	"I wake after a sleep of thirty-four years, and already I have company! I see you have traveled far. Perhaps you can tell me what has transpired while I slumbered."	Greetings.		Artorius Veritas NPC 480
92	I am Duroth the Eternal. By besting the guards you have earned the right of speaking to me. What do you want?	What brings you again to Duroth the Eternal?		Duroth the Eternal NPC 481

100	What do you want?	What do you want?		various
101	"Are you the new recruits? Of course you are! Why else would you be seeking me out? I'm ex-Captain Terrence, here to help you on your way to becoming proper Regnan sailors."	"Ah, the new recruits again! What can I do for you?"		Ex-captain Terrence NPC 511
