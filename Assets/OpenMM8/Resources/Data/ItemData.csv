2;item002;Trollish War Sword;200;Weapon;Sword;3d3;3;8;3;Longsword;1;0;0;16;132;Though of primitive craftsmanship, the great weight of this weapon's blade gives it excellent striking power.
3;item003;Dark Elven Longsword;350;Weapon;Sword;3d3;6;8;6;Longsword;1;0;0;14;136;The weapon of a merchantman from the Dark Elven city of Alvar. It's wavy edged blade holds a good edge.
4;item004;Templar's Sword;500;Weapon;Sword;3d3;9;8;9;Longsword;1;0;0;14;136;A sword for a true swordsman. Its lack of ornamentation bespeaks of the singular purpose of its design.
5;item005;Champion's Sword;650;Weapon;Sword;3d3;12;8;12;Longsword;1;0;0;18;138;These are made exclusively for members of the Erathian Order of the Blade. Since by tradition they are buried with their fallen wielders on hallowed and guarded grounds, they are rare articles indeed.
6;item006;Two-Handed Sword;400;Weapon2;Sword;4d5;0;8;1;Two-Handed Sword;2;0;0;16;162;This blade's great weight and length give its blows greater reach and damage. Otherwise, it is unexceptional in quality.
7;item007;Dark Elven Bastard Sword;500;Weapon2;Sword;4d5;2;8;4;Two-Handed Sword;2;0;0;18;155;Often carried by Elven caravan guards, these slightly under-proportioned blades are nearly, but not quite, light enough to brandish single-handedly.
8;item008;Minotaur Battlesword;800;Weapon2;Sword;4d5;6;8;7;Two-Handed Sword;2;0;0;20;169;Only those possessed of great strength and balance can gracefully swing these mighty blades let alone control them in the heat of combat.

10;item010;Headsman's Reaver;2000;Weapon2;Sword;4d5;12;8;13;Two-Handed Sword;2;0;0;17;171;Crafted from purified erudine alloy and then tempered in a pool of roiling lava, this sword's practically undullable and perfectly balanced blade backs up its intimidating appearance.
11;item011;Iron Broadsword;100;Weapon;Sword;3d4;0;8;1;Broadsword;3;0;0;21;132;Some swordsmen swear that the soft metal of an iron sword gives them certain combat advantages. Those swordsmen never seem to be very old.
12;item012;Trollish Claymore;300;Weapon;Sword;3d4;2;8;4;Broadsword;3;0;0;19;138;Though of primitive design and craftsmanship, these Troll forged weapons are effective in strong hands.

14;item014;Knightly Broadsword;800;Weapon;Sword;3d4;9;8;9;Broadsword;3;0;0;12;131;The weight of this sword's untapered blade would make it unwieldy if not for its exacting counterbalance.

17;item017;Goblin Scimitar;290;Weapon;Sword;2d4;2;7;3;Cutlass;4;0;0;20;134;After the Gowdar Deep Goblins were wiped off the face of Jadame in the Goblin-Ogre Wars, thousands of these weapons appeared on the common market.
18;item018;Regnan Cutlass;590;Weapon;Sword;2d4;6;7;5;Cutlass;4;0;0;19;140;Issued to Regnan seamen as a basic side arm, these blades have gained a sturdy reputation.
19;item019;Regnan Falchion;750;Weapon;Sword;2d4;8;7;9;Cutlass;4;0;0;18;143;The extremely forward balance of this weapon's blade gives it extra striking power, but requires great strength and skill from its wielder.
20;item020;Captain's Cutlass;1100;Weapon;Sword;2d4;11;7;12;Cutlass;4;0;0;25;136;Given to Regnan captains upon gaining their first command, these superior weapons help them to dominate their foes and subordinate.
21;item021;Crude Dagger;8;Weapon;Dagger;2d2;0;6;1;Dagger;5;0;0;16;77;As much a cutting tool and eating implement as a weapon, this dagger of soft steel will take an edge, but will lose it through very little use.
22;item022;Crystal Dagger;100;Weapon;Dagger;2d2;2;6;2;Dagger;5;0;0;12;75;These daggers are often carried by members of the Necromancers' Guild. The crystals used for the blades are found in the Shadowspire mountains. They are incredibly sharp, but have a tendency to shatter.
23;item023;Merchantman's Dagger;150;Weapon;Dagger;2d2;3;6;4;Dagger;5;0;0;14;80;This dagger is a typical example of those produced by the weaponsmiths of Alvar. It is made of hardened steel and has excellent balance.
24;item024;Master's Dagger;250;Weapon;Dagger;2d2;5;6;6;Dagger;5;0;0;19;80;Daggers of this quality are rare indeed. Made of erudine and rare woods, finished in gold, and set with a sizable ruby, this would be a rich man's extravagance if it were not also so effective a weapon.
25;item025;Fanged Blade;300;Weapon;Dagger;2d2;6;6;9;Dagger;5;0;0;20;45;The grip on this blade has clearly been rewrapped many times. It is said that such blades were used by the first Vampires who appeared millennia before the Silence. Could this possibly be one of those ancient weapons?
26;item026;Long Dagger;15;Weapon;Dagger;2d3;0;7;1;Long Dagger;6;0;0;15;102;With a blade in length between sword and dagger, these weapons are meant for the knife fighter who desires a bit of extra reach. This particular weapon is of mediocre workmanship in soft steel.
27;item027;Alvarian Poignard;200;Weapon;Dagger;2d3;2;7;4;Long Dagger;6;0;0;14;105;At many social functions in Alvar, it is deemed inappropriate to carry a sword. It is common for Elven warriors to carry a smaller blade in case things become uncivil.
28;item028;Regnan Fighting Knife;350;Weapon;Dagger;2d3;4;7;7;Long Dagger;6;0;0;13;103;Not wishing to be encumbered by a shield, many Regnan pirate raiders fight with a cutlass in one hand and one of these shorter blades in the other.
29;item030;Twilight Kris;500;Weapon;Dagger;2d3;6;7;9;Long Dagger;6;0;0;20;106;This wavy bladed long dagger of the best quality steel is the product of the Twilight weaponsmiths. The bat wing guard set with a blood red ruby marks it as the weapon of a Vampire.
30;item029;Dueling Long Dagger;790;Weapon;Dagger;2d3;7;7;12;Long Dagger;6;0;0;19;103;While they present a united front to the rest of the world, there is much internal strife among the Vampires of Shadowspire. By custom, very serious differences are settled in battle using these deadly blades of exquisite craftwork.
31;item031;Stone Axe;30;Weapon;Axe;4d2;0;5;1;Axe;7;0;0;30;84;Not much more than fire-hardened sticks lashed to sharp stones, these crude implements make for poor tools and weapons.
32;item032;Battle Hatchet;100;Weapon;Axe;4d2;2;5;2;Axe;7;0;0;28;86;Often carried by mounted knights as a secondary arm, battle hatchets are preferred by some who carry them to the exclusion to any sword.

34;item034;Dwarven Battleaxe;550;Weapon;Axe;4d2;8;5;6;Axe;7;0;0;37;110;While the blacksmiths of the Jadamean Dark Dwarves are not as skilled as their Erathian counterparts, they still produce a product superior to most of what is otherwise available.
35;item035;Minotaur Battleaxe;775;Weapon;Axe;4d2;11;5;9;Axe;7;0;0;41;110;Forged by the Minotaurs for their wars with the Ogres, these axes are forged of a secret alloy formula. Their edges are difficult to dull and even harder to sharpen.
36;item036;Two-Handed Axe;225;Weapon2;Axe;3d7;0;6;1;Two-Handed Axe;8;0;0;40;92;As much an implement for working wood as a weapon, this crude axe can still deliver a telling blow.
37;item038;Footman's Axe;450;Weapon2;Axe;3d7;2;6;4;Two-Handed Axe;8;0;0;42;106;Capable of splitting armor, these two-handed axes are a favorite among soldiers facing mounted knights.

43;item043;Elven Long Spear;250;Weapon1or2;Spear;1d9;5;6;6;Spear;9;0;0;13;119;The fine craftsmanship and balance of this alloy steel headed spear mark it as the work of the weaponsmiths of Alvar.
44;item044;War Spear;450;Weapon1or2;Spear;1d9;9;6;9;Spear;9;0;0;25;124;This spear is built for battle. Far to heavy to be wielded by the part-time militiaman, it is built for the professional warrior who prefers the spear to other weapons.
45;item045;Dragon Harpoon;650;Weapon1or2;Spear;1d9;13;6;12;Spear;9;0;0;17;111;The back-barbed stalt steel head of this weapon is designed to deal grievous damage to even the most ancient of dragons. Naturally, it is the spearfighter's choice for dispatching all foes.
46;item046;Improvised Voulge;200;Weapon1or2;Spear;3d6;0;6;1;Halberd;10;0;0;34;93;This simple poleaxe appears to have been made by attaching the blade of a farm implement to a poorly crafted spear.
47;item048;Halberd;400;Weapon1or2;Spear;3d6;3;6;3;Halberd;10;0;0;30;111;A versatile weapon combining the qualities of an axe and a spear, the halberd is designed to perform in formation and individual close quarter fighting.
48;item047;Beaked Halberd;700;Weapon1or2;Spear;3d6;6;6;5;Halberd;10;0;0;38;107;This improved halberd has a spiked blade opposite its axe face to provide both balance and a means of penetrating plate armor.
49;item049;Minotaur Campaign Pole-axe;1300;Weapon1or2;Spear;3d6;10;6;8;Halberd;10;0;0;38;123;"When the Minotaurs went to war with the Frost Giants of faraway Vori, their king Balthazar commissioned this polearm to arm his troops. He reportedly said, ""Since they will be gone so long, arm them with something versatile."""
50;item050;Labyrinth Grapple;1600;Weapon1or2;Spear;3d6;13;6;11;Halberd;10;0;0;24;135;Minotaurs have very little tolerance for intruders in their hallowed mazes. This fact is well evidenced in the attention paid to weapons constructed for the labyrinth guards.
51;item051;Hayfork;100;Weapon1or2;Spear;2d6;0;6;1;Trident;11;0;0;25;113;Though a common farming implement, this hayfork is of sturdy construction and could be an excellent, if improvised, weapon.
52;item052;Infantry Fork;400;Weapon1or2;Spear;2d6;2;6;3;Trident;11;0;0;27;137;A highly specialized piece of equipment intended to equalize contests between foot soldiers and mounted, armored opponents, these modified spears are effective if slightly clumsy weapons.

55;item055;Triton Trident;1250;Weapon1or2;Spear;2d6;13;6;12;Trident;11;0;0;26;125;The first thing one notices when first handling this trident is that it is unusually cool to the touch. The second is a sense that the dragon turtle bone tines seem to seek vulnerabilities in their targets' defenses as if guided by an unseen hand.
56;item056;Hunting Bow;200;Missile;Bow;5d2;0;6;1;Bow;12;0;0;23;96;These lightweight bows of simple construction are meant for bringing down small game animals - not for direct combat.

58;item058;Snakewood Bow;400;Missile;Bow;5d2;4;3;6;Bow;12;0;0;24;100;The human soldiers of Enroth carry bows made from the native snakewood tree. The strong, flexible wood makes a sturdy bow.
59;item059;Elven Warbow;500;Missile;Bow;5d2;6;3;9;Bow;12;0;0;23;102;By laminating together layers of wood, steel, and bone the bowsmiths of Alvar have created a bow of perfect balance, strength and accuracy. The process consumes a lot of time, craft and expensive materials which explains the steep price these bows command.
60;item060;Devilbone Bow;750;Missile;Bow;5d2;7;3;12;Bow;12;0;0;30;100;Dark Elven bowsmiths have discovered that unusual characteristics of the Kreegan spinal column make it the best material for heavy bowstaves. A clever arrangement of composite pulleys make it possible for those of less than superhuman strength to pull these mighty weapons.
61;item061;Light Crossbow;50;Missile;Bow;4d2;0;4;1;Crossbow;13;0;0;28;70;Because of their ease of use, crossbows like these are stockpiled in militia armories everywhere. Their low pull strength and mediocre workmanship however, make them only moderately effective.
62;item062;Blood Drop Crossbow;200;Missile;Bow;4d2;3;4;3;Crossbow;13;0;0;26;75;A light crossbow of good quality, these weapons feature a grooved table, basic sights and a smooth releasing nut.

64;item064;Caravaner's Crossbow;400;Missile;Bow;4d2;7;4;9;Crossbow;13;0;0;38;85;The Merchants of Alvar like to see their caravan guards well armed. This well-crafted heavy crossbow has a cranked drawing mechanism.
65;item065;Regnan Crossbow;550;Missile;Bow;4d2;8;4;12;Crossbow;13;0;0;37;92;The pirates of Regna Island have spent centuries perfecting their crossbow design. The resulting weapon has a crystal lensed sight and bowstaves of pure stalt - which would make the bow impossible to cock if not for the crank draw of erudine alloy.
66;item066;Mace;50;Weapon;Mace;2d4;0;6;1;Mace;14;0;0;22;116;A slight improvement over the common club, maces are better balanced, more durable, and deliver greater damage.
67;item067;Flail;150;Weapon;Mace;2d4;2;6;3;Flail;14;0;0;58;113;Though evolved from the farm implement which shares its name, the flail's great reach and striking power make it a fearsome weapon.
68;item068;Temple Mace;300;Weapon;Mace;2d4;5;6;6;Mace;14;0;0;33;126;"The sunray corona circling the head of this well made mace serves as a devotional declaration for Temple of the Sun clerics; it also greatly increases the damage of its blows. "
69;item069;Reverend Sceptre;450;Weapon;Mace;2d4;7;6;9;Mace;14;0;0;12;159;As much a symbol of office as weapon, these finely crafted maces are carried by inner circle Sun Temple priests. Its highly decorated shaft belies the effectiveness of the gilded erudine-steel head.
70;item070;Trollish War Mace;600;Weapon;Mace;2d4;11;6;12;Mace;14;0;0;30;177;While most races have concentrated on developing bladed weapons, the Trolls have always been content to refine the simple bludgeon. This brutal weapon forged as a single piece of stalt alloy is the finest example of their craft.
71;item071;Sledgehammer;120;Weapon;Mace;2d5;0;6;1;Hammer;15;0;0;26;76;This hammer is more a construction tool than a weapon. Still, it could deliver a telling, if clumsy, blow.
72;item072;Field Hammer;300;Weapon;Mace;2d5;3;6;3;Hammer;15;0;0;21;107;This hammer was designed as secondary infantry arm designed to finish off armored opponents who have fallen to the ground.

74;item074;Sun Hammer;650;Weapon;Mace;2d5;9;6;8;Hammer;15;0;0;19;107;Clerics of the Sun are prohibited from using bladed weapons. That they carry such fine warhammers is the natural result of this restriction. As an added measure of devotion, a reverse image of their sun symbol is embossed on the striking face.
75;item075;Trollish Maul;890;Weapon;Mace;2d5;12;6;12;Hammer;15;0;0;31;107;It is necessary to handle this weapon to appreciate its perfect grip and balance. The hammer's head is carved from a single mineral crystal. Trollish weaponsmiths spend a lifetime mastering the shaping technique to produce a head that retains incredible hardness without being shatter prone.
76;item076;Club;1;Weapon;Club;1d3;0;3;0;Club;16;0;0;16;119;A wooden head and handle studded with short iron spikes, the simple club's best attribute is that it can be constructed from found materials.
77;item077;Thornbark Club;100;Weapon;Club;1d3;3;3;2;Club;16;0;0;31;148;The Trolls of the Ironsand Desert make these clubs by fire-hardening the fantastically tough root wood of the thornbark tree.
78;item078;Overlord's Club;350;Weapon;Mace;3d3;6;3;5;Club;16;0;0;26;161;Troll tribal chieftains must win their position through trial by combat. The winner keeps his club as a symbol of office. The losers' clubs often find their way into the weapon marketplace.
79;item079;Journey Staff;40;Weapon2;Staff;2d4;0;3;1;Staff;17;0;0;10;63;Many dangers face the Jadamean traveler. Even the least battle-minded carry some sort of weapon. These iron ended walking sticks are a common choice.

81;item081;Priestly Staff;250;Weapon2;Staff;2d4;4;3;5;Staff;17;0;0;14;95;This finely decorated staff is the product of Lizardman craft. Wrapped with exotic leathers, and ended with a bronze footcap and striker, these staves are carried by Lizardman priests as a symbol of station.
82;item082;Serpent Staff;400;Weapon2;Staff;2d4;6;3;8;Staff;17;0;0;18;100;These rare staffs may appear unwieldy, but they are the product of sorcery. In combat they flex with animal intelligence to work in blows through their targets' defenses.

Additionally, a secret process makes the suit resistant to salt water corrosion.

89;item089;Rusty Mail Vest;400;Armor;Chain;8;0;6;1;Chainmail;21;0;0;0;0;This corroded ring mail vest has seen better days. It has been field repaired in many places and even has a large patch of thinner mail salvaged from a piece of chain cowl.

91;item091;Minotaur Chainmail;900;Armor;Chain;8;10;6;10;Chainmail;21;0;0;0;0;Of a design originally created by the Minotaurs for their Vori campaigns, this type of chainmail, with its good coverage and fine construction, has proven popular among other races. Now the armorsmiths of Bathazar Lair construct it in sizes for any with ready gold to spend.
92;item092;Siertal Chainmail;1300;Armor;Chain;8;18;6;15;Chainmail;21;0;0;0;0;The Alvarian Dark Elves guard their siertal-alloy formula carefully. Chainmail made from this metal is both light and capable of turning the hardest blades.

Legend says the Blade of Light, Elsenrail, and the Blade of Dark, Glomenthal, will play major roles in the last act of the universe.
501;item296;Glomenthal;20000;Weapon;Sword;3d3;14;Artifact;20;Longsword;1;0;0;29;159;(Might +40, 10-20 points of Dark damage) The Forge of Chaos was destroyed in the making of the Swords of Balance.

502;item236;Terminus;15000;Weapon;Sword;3d4;14;Artifact;20;Broadsword;3;0;0;22;141;(Armsmaster skill +7, Air Resistance +30) As a child, before he carved his barbarian kingdom in Vori, Lars Eilief found this sword deep in an ice cave. When he died, it was set adrift with him on his funeral barge. How it ended up in Jadame is a mystery.
503;item237;Judicious Measure;20000;Weapon;Sword;2d4;13;Artifact;20;Cutlass;4;0;0;33;136;(Endurance +40, Luck +40, Ogre Slaying) Before there was a Regnan Empire, the ancestors of the Trolls of Ironsand lived on Regna Island. With this blade and a horde of sea raiders, Hareck I ousted the Trolls and formed his pirate nation.

""A single blow will both fell a tree and render it into firewood!"" he was heard to exclaim. That he was soon found slain and the axe gone missing is proof that someone saw a better use for the tool."
506;item045;Wyrm Spitter;20000;Weapon1or2;Spear;1d9;14;Artifact;20;Spear;9;0;0;17;141;(Endurance +20, Dragon Slaying, Swift) Arguably the best dragon hunter of all times, Sir Ryan Smedly carried this mighty spear with him on all his expeditions, claiming that with it in hand, he could best any dragon in single combat. This proved true, but nevertheless he was slain by no less than a dozen dragons who ambushed him at Shadowmarsh Pass.
507;item243;Guardian;15000;Weapon1or2;Spear;3d6;15;Artifact;20;Halberd;10;0;0;48;160;(+10 to all attributes, 10-20 points of Body damage) The great Vampire, Korbu was known to use living men to guard his crypt during daylight hours. Compelled by a spell of enslavement, these sorry souls would walk their rounds carrying these mighty halberds. When Korbu mysteriously vanished, and the slave spell failed, a few of these weapons appeared in the larger world.
508;item239;Foulfang;20000;Weapon;Dagger;2d3;10;Artifact;20;Long Dagger;6;0;0;20;94;(Vampiric, 10 points of Poison damage, Vampire) At the conclusion of the Vampires' War of the Chalice, Korbu exacted horrific retribution on his defeated enemy, Calden Fain. It is better for the world that knowledge of the necromantic arts which rendered Fain--body and soul--into this living blade, is lost.
509;item249;Scepter of Kings;20000;Weapon;Mace;2d4;14;Artifact;20;Mace;14;0;0;20;95;"(Personality + 40, Regenerate Hit Points) Uri Hossana, King of the Western Elves, also called ""The Drunken King,"" was deposed the day he carelessly misplaced his scepter of office while on a hunting trip. This proved to be the last blunder of an incapable ruler. His advisors relieved him of his crown and left him to fend for himself in the Howling Marsh. He was never seen again."
510;item247;Breaker;20000;Weapon;Mace;3d3;12;Artifact;20;Club;16;0;0;36;187;(Might +20, Endurance +20, 10-20 points of Body damage) Trollish folklore is full of the fables of Sevenstrong Burlfist who with Biter, his faithful wolf companion, and his mighty club, Breaker, endlessly quested for the Silver Rose. Fables? One must wonder, if Breaker exists, then why not too, the Silver Rose?
511;item250;Staff of the Swamp;20000;Weapon2;Staff;3d4;10;Artifact;20;Staff;17;0;0;31;113;"(of Shielding; Immune to disease, paralysis, and poison) Nemerit, an otherwise unremarkable witch of the last era, was renown for her staff artificing skill. She created a staff for every conceivable use. It is said she carried this staff on reagent collecting trips into the swamplands."
512;item245;Longseeker;20000;Missile;Bow;5d2;10;Artifact;20;Bow;12;0;0;26;101;(Accuracy +50, Swift, Bow skill +4) Legends tell of many great archer heroes, but none greater than Brennan Morland of whom it was said once pierced a gold sovereign at 300 paces in an archery tournament. Now, holding his bow you must wonder if the legend owes more to the bow than the man.
513;item251;Serendine's Preservation;20000;Armor;Leather;4;30;Artifact;20;Leather Armor;20;0;0;0;0;(Regenerates Spell Points, Endurance +30) A mage known as much for frailty of body as for magical prowess, Serendine of Freehaven built this armor to make the most of his strengths and the least of his weaknesses.
514;item252;Glomenmail;20000;Armor;Chain;8;40;Artifact;20;Chainmail;21;0;0;0;0;(+10 to all statistics, +10 to all resistances, Dark Elf) Dark and Light Elven dealings have been peaceable, if uneasy, for centuries. Before that there was nothing but war. Few suits of this Dark Elven war armor have survived the ravages of time. Those that have are understandably, coveted.
515;item253;Supreme Plate;20000;Armor;Plate;20;50;Artifact;20;Plate Armor;22;0;0;0;0;(Swift, +15 Speed, +15 Accuracy, Knight) Each grandmaster of the Blackshire Armorers' Guild creates a masterpiece suit of plate as proof of his right to hold his station. It is not unusual for a guild member to spend ten to twenty years in the creation of one of these suits.
516;item254;Eclipse;0;Shield;Shield;6;15;Artifact;20;Large Shield;23;0;0;38;73;Quest Item: (of Spirit, of Body, of Mind, Cleric) When the First Temple of the Sun was burned in the War of Dove and Crow fought between the Sun and Moon temples, the holy altar was melted. The altar's metal was later collected and incorporated into this shield carried by Sun Priest Derico during his final deciding campaign of the war.
517;item261;Fleetfingers;20000;Gauntlets;Misc;3;0;Artifact;20;Gauntlets;30;0;0;0;0;(+8 to Disarm Trap, Bow, and Armsmaster skills) That she would actually have a name for her gloves, is evidence of the flamboyant, if deserved, conceit of Darcie Darby--most widely known for her theft of the bejeweled Rod of Right, part of the royal regalia of Enroth.
518;item262;Herald's Boots;20000;Boots;Misc;2;8;Artifact;20;Boots;31;0;0;0;0;(Speed + 30, Swift, Immunity to Sleep) When Jerico Ironfist secured the throne in the First War of Enrothian Succession, he sent forth heralds to spread the news. They were given pairs of these boots so the news would be spread quickly and thus soonest end widespread civil unrest.
519;item140;Ring of Planes;20000;Ring;Misc;0;0;Artifact;20;Ring;32;0;0;0;0;(+40 to Fire, Earth, Water and Air resistances) When the cartographer Alvia Morrania went to chart the terrain of the elemental planes she went well prepared. This ring of general protection was among the many special items commissioned by the Enrothian courts in support of her expedition.
520;item256;Drogg's Helm;20000;Helm;Misc;2;10;Artifact;20;Helm;25;0;0;0;0;(Personality +15, Intellect +15, Regenerates Hit Points) In the history of the barbarian tribes of Vori, it is rare to find a long reigning chieftain. Rarer still is one who held his position through magic rather than might. Drogg was such--a warrior mage who survived many years of rival challenges. It is said that he wore his helmet, even in sleep. Now that you possess it, you understand why.
521;item258;Crown of Final Dominion;20000;Helm;Misc;0;0;Artifact;30;Crown;27;0;0;0;0;(Intellect +50, of Dark Magic, Lich) So named by its creator and only sovereign wearer, Mederon, the first and last Lich Emperor of Nighon.

Since this is an event of extreme infrequency, angel wings are a very rare commodity. Archangel wings are almost never seen. When used as a material, they imbue the resulting item with fantastic powers.
523;item234;Snake;30000;Weapon;Sword;3d4;12;Relic;30;Longsword;1;0;0;23;169;(Slows target, Water Resistance -50, Personality -15) The pommel of this sword is gruesomely butted by a shrunken medusa's head. Though greatly diminished, the medusa's power flows along Snake's blade and into its targets--a good design, but poorly implemented, for some of the negative energies flow into the sword's wielder as well.
524;item004;Havoc;30000;Weapon;Sword;3d3;15;Relic;30;Longsword;1;0;0;15;136;(Speed +70, Accuracy +70, Armor Class -20) Havoc's enchantment makes it able to readily defeat any target's defenses. Unfortunately, its aggressive spirit makes it indifferent to parrying movements.
525;item010;Finality;30000;Weapon2;Sword;4d5;15;Relic;30;Two-Handed Sword;2;0;0;17;161;(10-20 points of Fire damage, Slow, Speed -20) When the arch assassin, Demetri Razen was finally brought to justice, it was found that his skin was granted unusual hardness by a permanent enchantment. Normal blades would not cut him, so Finality was forged to deliver the death blow sentenced by the Enrothian courts. 
526;item248;Hell's Cleaver;30000;Weapon;Axe;4d2;12;Relic;30;Axe;7;0;0;24;124;"(Might + 70, Accuracy +70, Personality -50, Intellect -50) So called because of its power to demonize its wielder, nevertheless, there are many who would willingly pay the price for the power offered by ""Hell's Cleaver."""
527;item242;Spiritslayer;30000;Weapon1or2;Spear;1d9;13;Relic;30;Spear;9;0;0;17;124;(Vampiric, Might +50, Luck -40) Many under the rule of Luthiner the Severe saw the existence of his spear Spiritslayer as proof of the existence of evil. The injuries caused by the spear go beyond the physical as Spiritslayer takes a strike as an opportunity to drink its target's very essence.
528;item244;Trident of Rulership;30000;Weapon1or2;Spear;2d6;13;Relic;30;Spear;9;0;0;20;133;(Water Breathing, +70 Water Resistance, -70 Fire Resistance) The Trident of Rulership was never meant to be on dry land, yet when the once mighty, ocean to ocean, Triton empire collapsed, many of its greatest artifacts including those of its royal treasure were looted and made their way to the surface.
529;item238;Blade of Mercy;30000;Weapon;Dagger;2d2;15;Relic;30;Dagger;5;0;0;17;84;(Might +40, 4-10 points Electrical damage, Accuracy -40, Necromancer) Though generally considered unfashionable among current necromantic customs, live sacrifice was once widely practiced. To reduce the cruelty inflicted on his victims, the Necromancer Ferredine the Merciful created a blade capable of bringing about a quicker and less suffered end.
530;item083;Staff of Elements;30000;Weapon2;Staff;2d4;4;Relic;30;Staff;17;0;0;34;108;(of Air Magic, of Fire Magic, of Water Magic, of Earth Magic, -40 Armor Class) By imposing upon its wielder a deepened state of concentration, the Staff of Elements increases his or her affinity with elemental magic to a profound degree. Of course, it is not always a good thing to have one's attention taken away from one's immediate concerns.
531;item059;Tournament Bow;30000;Missile;Bow;5d2;10;Relic;30;Bow;12;0;0;19;87;(Accuracy +100, Bow skill + 5, Armor Class -20) This bow was built to the specifications of the great Elven tournament archer, Terin Tourfeather. More concerned with fancy shooting than with the realities of the battlefield, the bow's detrimental effects were of no concern to Tourfeather--more workaday wielders should pay more heed.
532;item246;Lightning Crossbow;30000;Missile;Bow;4d2;12;Relic;30;Crossbow;13;0;0;36;87;(Swift, Accuracy -50, Dark Elf) An ingenious combination of the mechanical and magical went into the creation of this self-cocking crossbow which launches its quarrels with incredible force. That the same launching force causes it to kick like a mule means only the most skilled can use it to any good effect.
533;item251;Last Stage Cuirass;30000;Armor;Leather;4;15;Relic;30;Leather Armor;20;0;0;0;0;(Personality +80, Intellect +70, -30 Mind and Spirit resistances) The final stage of degeneration from their human form leaves a Lich completely soulless and thus immune to certain magics. Such liches often curse their personal items with vulnerabilities to these magics to dissuade others from using them.
534;item255;Herondale's Lost Shield;30000;Shield;Shield;4;10;Relic;30;Small Shield;24;0;0;61;52;"(Immune to Fear, Stone, Paralysis, and Sleep; Personality -15, Luck -15) The great knight Gerrald Herondale abandoned this shield after it took the brunt of a dark and deadly curse. Though it still retained its great powers, the shield was also weighed down with malevolent energies."
535;item141;Ring of Fusion;30000;Ring;Misc;0;0;Relic;30;Ring;32;0;0;0;0;(of Water, Alchemy skill + 5, Intellect +40, Endurance -20) A lost relic of the Freehaven Alchemists' Guild, until its disappearance, this ring was the signet of the guildmaster. It was meant to be worn only during the mixing of the most powerful potions for it drew much energy from the user.
536;item115;Lucky Hat;30000;Helm;Misc;0;0;Relic;30;Hat;26;0;0;0;0;(Luck + 90, Personality -50) The only reason someone would wear this hat is for the luck it conveys. It is the farthest thing from flattering!
537;item121;Berserker Belt;30000;Belt;Misc;0;0;Relic;30;Belt;28;0;0;0;0;"(Might +100, Immune to Fear, Accuracy -30, Armor Class -15) An experiment of the Blackshire Artificers' Guild, this belt was designed to turn its wearer into the perfect warrior--mighty and fearless. No more were made when in field tests it became apparent that ""foolhardy"" and ""careless"" were not virtues of the perfect warrior."
538;item068;Mace of the Sun;12000;Weapon;Mace;3d4;7;Special;0;Mace;14;Elemental Slaying;0;33;124;Though at first it appears to be the same type of mace carried by Sun Temple clerics everywhere, this item seems to thrum with conflicting energies.
539;item045;Ebonest;0;Weapon1or2;Spear;2d9;13;Special;0;Spear;9;Dragon Slaying;0;17;139;Quest Item: Charles Quixote's personal spear of Dragon slaying, Ebonest is a fine weapon indeed. When used against a Dragon, it seems to aim unerringly for the chinks between its target's tough scales.
540;item010;Sword of Whistlebone;0;Weapon2;Sword;4d5;12;Special;0;Two-Handed Sword;2;Dragon Slaying;0;17;159;Quest Item: That the Whistlebones would settle upon such a fierce weapon for their heirloom speaks much of their commitment to the family business of Dragon hunting.
541;item040;Axe of Balthazar;0;Weapon2;Axe;3d7;15;Special;0;Two-Handed Axe;8;of Ice;0;41;110;"Quest Item: No Minotaur kings wear a crown. Instead as their badge of office they carry great axes of the finest workmanship. This axe was lost when Balthazar was betrayed by the Vori Frost Giants. That it is strongly enchanted is clear; when used in battle its blows deliver both normal damage and impart a numbing bite of freezing cold."
542;item060;Noblebone Bow;15000;Missile;Bow;5d4;12;Special;30;Bow;12;of Carnage;0;30;100;"Bows of Kreegan bone are highly sought after; the material is strong and takes enchantments easily. The most sought after bone comes from Kreegans of the devil race's former ruling class."
