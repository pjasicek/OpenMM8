1;My fellow Journeyman, we face grave times.  Hopefully our Master will find a way for us to leave this troubled region and return safely to Alvar.  I would not wish to end my life here, even though it is the place of my birth.;;S'ton;;
2;Dadeross led us here to trade with the Lizardman Clan of Onefang for their tobersk fruit.  He has gone to talk with Brekish Onefang, the village leader.  Perhaps you should look for him?;;S'ton;;
3;The Regnan Pirates are a threat to the economy and free travel in Jadame.  Very few boats ply the sea, for fear of being sunk…or worse!  When in Ravenshore, I did hear rumors of a small band of smugglers who have been working beneath the notice of the pirates.  I wonder how they do that!;;S'ton;;
4;"It is as I have read in the prophecy of the Unmaking! ""...and a Mountain of Fire shall rise from the sea, like a wound drawn by the quick stroke of a dagger…"".";;;;
;;;;;
"You must find a way off of these islands, if not for the caravan, at least for yourself!  Someone must take news of what has happened here to the Merchant Council in Alvar!  They must know of the cataclysm and of the Regnan raid!""";;Dadeross;;;
5;The pirates from the dread Island of Regna are using the cataclysm and the confusion created by it to aid them in overrunning the islands.  If they conquer Dagger Wound, they can use it as an outpost for direct raids on Ravenshore!  The Merchant Council in Alvar must be notified!  You must find a way to the boats and tell them!;;Dadeross;;
6;It will take several boats to ferry the entire caravan back to Ravenshore, or many trips by one boat.  This cannot be done until the waters around the Dagger Wound Islands are free from Regnan Pirates.  It is best that you return to Alvar and tell the Council of the Regnan attack.  They will send help to rescue us!;;Dadeross;;
7;In the middle of the night the ground shook!  Flaming rocks dropped from the sky!  Many of my people were hurt or killed!  Great damage was done to the village.  The bridges that allowed travel between the smaller islands and the main island were destroyed.  We found ourselves stuck on the main island, unable to reach those on the smaller islands who may be injured.  Many family members and friends are missing.  We cannot reach the islands with the boat docks, and thus we are unable to send to Ravenshore for help. I do not even know if any boats survived!;;Brekish Onefang;;
8;In time long past, my people used the Portals of Stone to travel quickly from island to island, but we have lost the knowledge of their operation. Only the pair connecting the village to the southwestern fields still functions. Now that the bridges are gone, we're trapped on the island!;;Brekish Onefang;;
9;A Cleric, by the name of Fredrick Talimere, has been living with us for the last few years.  He has been studying the Portals of Stone and the outer ruins of the Abandoned Temple.  Maybe he has the knowledge to get the Portals working again!  Find him and see if he will help!;;Brekish Onefang;;
10;"Ah yes…""the portals."" I have been studying them and the lost culture that built them for years.";;;;
;;;;;
"They were built by the civilization that had its day long before the Lizardmen came to inhabit these islands. They were a means of instantaneous travel between the islands. Sadly, the power stones needed to operate them are in short supply.""";;Fredrick Talimere;;;
11;The first night of the mountain of fire, I went to the beach to see if I could see anything of its eruption.  I cannot be certain, but as the volcano continued to erupt, I thought I saw Earth Elementals roaming the lava encrusted base of the mountain.;;Fredrick Talimere;;
12;So Clanleader Onefang gave you that power stone he was holding onto! It will power the portal on the southwestern tip of the island. To use it, hold an image of the stone in your mind as you step onto the portal.;;Fredrick Talimere;;
13;The ruins of a temple built by the lost civilization lies on the island just northwest of the main island. I have not explored it however, for dangerous reptiles have made it their lair. I do suspect that the temple leads to an underwater tunnel which surfaces near the boat docks on the northwest island.;;;;
;;;;;
"With the bridges out, that tunnel may be the only way to reach the docks and a boat to safety!""";;Fredrick Talimere;;;
14;My brother, Isthric the Tongue, went to check on the tobersk plants on one of the lesser islands.  He has not returned!  I am afraid that he is one of those stranded by the cataclysm. He may even be hurt!  If you were to fix the Portals of Stone, he would surely be able to return, and we could get help to those who need it!  Find him for me!;;Rohtnax;;
15;My Granda used to tell us of the times past, when the Portals of Stone were the main travel route between the islands.  She told us that the keys to the Portals disappeared during one of the first raids committed by the Regnan Pirates.  If the Portals of Stone were working my brother Isthric could return back to the main island!;;Rohtnax;;
16;That rude man?  He's more concerned with that Abandoned Temple than he is with the life that goes on around him!  My Granda warned him that the Temple is a place of great Evil.  He never listened.  Now Granda isn't with us anymore and we have no one but Brekish Onefang to remind us of the past.;;Rohtnax;;
17;We have offended the Ancients!  Why else would they call up the Mountain of Fire!  The Prophecies tell of a time when the oceans would boil!  This is the beginning of the end!;;Pascella Tisk;;
18;There are many Prophecies that tell of the destruction of Jadame and the entire world!   Most tell of a time when the world will be consumed by that which created it.  Perhaps the Ancients have decided to wipe us all out!;;Pascella Tisk;;
19;There is one Prophecy, the Prophecy of the Snake, that I have been unable to find a copy of.  I think it may be most revealing about the future of Jadame.;;;;
;;;;;
"Fredrick Talimere, the Cleric, has told me of the snake ruins, and of the Abandoned Temple.  He is in agreement with me, that there may be a copy of this prophecy, somewhere in the temple.  Could you find it for me?""";;Pascella Tisk;;;
20;You must find a way off of these islands. Someone must take news of what has happened here to our masters, the Merchants of Alvar!  They must know of the cataclysm and of the Regnan raid! ;;;;
;;;;;
"I've written a letter to the Merchants of Alvar representative in Ravenshore, Elgar Fellmoon. In it I explain our situation here. If anyone can advise us on what to do here, it is Fellmoon. Take this to him now.""";;Dadeross;;;
21;You must bring my letter to Elgar Fellmoon in Ravenshore!;;Dadeross;;
22;Take this crystal to Fredrick Talimere. I know that it has something to do with the portals of stone. Perhaps he can tell you how it functions.;;Brekish Onefang;;
23;Bring the portal crystal to Fredrick Talimere. He will know what it does.;;Brekish Onefang;;
24;The Merchant Council had sent our greatest warrior, Cauri Blackthorne, to consult with the Sun Temple priests about the disasters that have struck all of Jadame.;;;;
;;;;;
Cauri left for the Temple of the Sun in Murmurwoods shortly after rumors of the cataclysms were heard here in Alvar.  She was to return after consulting the priests.  We are very concerned that she has not returned.;;;;;
;;;;;
"As for your promotion, only Cauri can accurately test your skills and assess your worthiness for promotion.  If you find her, provide her with any assistance she may need and return here with news of her status and location.""";;Old Dark Elf;;;
25;Have you found Cauri?  We really need to know what happened to her!  Without her, we are all diminished!;;Old Dark Elf;;
26;Thank you for your assistance with the Basilisk Curse.  Usually I am prepared to handle the vile lizards, but this time there were just too many of them.;;;;
;;;;;
The Temple of the Sun asked me to check on a few pilgrims that were looking for the Druid Circle of Stone in this area.  When I found the first statue, I realized what had happened to the pilgrims.  ;;;;;
;;;;;
"I myself did not know of the increase in the number of Basilisks in this area.  They seem to be agitated by something.  I was going to investigate the Druid Circle of Stone when the Basilisks attacked me.""";;Cauri Blackthorne;;;
27;::Cauri looks over the Dark Elf(s) in your party::;;;;
;;;;;
To rescue me, you must have researched my path, and investigated the places I had been.  This demonstrates the intelligence needed to succeed in dealing with the world and business.;;;;;
;;;;;
To get to where I was attacked, you must have the skills needed to fight the Basilisks and other threats, demonstrating your prowess as a warrior.  Skill in battle is needed when proper negotiations break down.;;;;;
;;;;;
To ask me for promotion demonstrates desire, and without desire success will always escape your grasp.;;;;;
;;;;;
"You have all of the traits necessary to hold the title of Patriarch.  I will notify to Council upon my return.  It would be my pleasure to travel with you again.  You can find me in the Inn in Ravenshore.""";;Cauri Blackthorne;;;
28;I need to investigate the Circle of Stone further for the Temple of the Sun.  Hopefully not all of the pilgrims met the fate of these. Hopefully there are survivors!;;;;
;;;;;
"Something has agitated the creatures in this area, and I think the source can be found in the Circle.""";;Cauri Blackthorne;;;
29;You know…I have a power stone that will activate the portal to the abandoned temple. And you have one that will allow us to reach the island where that portal is!;;;;
;;;;;
If we joined forces, we could reach the temple with ease. What say you?;;;;;
;;;;;
"Fredrick Talimere offers to join your party.""";PLACEHOLDER;Fredrick Talimere;;;
30;Cauri returned and informed us of this assistance you provided her.  She also notified us of your promotion.  Congratulations, may your profits bring you much joy!;;Old Dark Elf;;
31;Cauri Blackthorne was here well over a week ago, maybe longer.  She had asked us many questions about the elemental incursions.  We provided her with what information we had here.  She said she would return to Alvar with the information.  Before she left, we asked her if she could do a favor for us.  We asked her if she could check on a group of pilgrims that were traveling to the old Druid Circle of Stone to the northeast of here.  She assured us that she would check in on them on her way back to Alvar.;;Cleric of the Sun;;
32;You come to me claiming to have a message from one of my caravan masters. Well, where is it then? If it was so important, perhaps you should have been better about not losing it along the way!;;Elgar Fellmoon;;
33;What is this? A letter from caravan master, Dadeross? Let's see…hmmm…;;;;
;;;;;
Well, it seems that serious events are afoot. It is a pity--what has happened on Dagger Wound. Serious action may need to be taken, but I require more information…;;;;;
;;;;;
"…and I think I know how to get it! Perhaps you would be interested in helping me? I will compensate you, of course. And, here. Take this as payment for delivering Dadeross' letter.""";;Elgar Fellmoon;;;
34;The local smugglers have the fastest boats in Ravenshore. If these were available to my agents, they could make quick scouting missions up and down the coast so we could see the extent of the cataclysm mentioned in Dadeross' letter.;;;;
;;;;;
"Here. Bring this letter to the smuggler leader, Arion Hunter. I'm sure it will """"persuade"""" him to lend his services. You'll find his hideout westward up the coast.";;;;;
;;;;;
"Oh, I almost forgot. The smugglers--they're wererats--and you know how they can be. Hunter can be reasoned with, but don't be surprised if his crew is less than civil.""";;Elgar Fellmoon;;;
35;Listen. We need those boats! Deliver my letter to Arion Hunter. Did you forget? His lair is to the west, up the coast!;;Elgar Fellmoon;;
36;Very good, and here is the payment we agreed upon. Hunter's boats will be useful to us through the crisis.;;;;
;;;;;
"Yes, """"crisis,"""" I say! Since your initial visit, several other caravans have missed their scheduled stops. There are also the rumors. Twice I've heard of the appearance of a burning lake of fire rising out of the desert.";;;;;
;;;;;
"Volcanoes! Lakes of fire! I fear the mysterious crystal has something to do with it. In any event, the guildmasters in Alvar must be informed!""";;Elgar Fellmoon;;;
37;As you may be aware, our guild headquarters is located in the city of Alvar. If you've never been there, the easiest way to reach it is to follow the river up through the canyon to the north.;;;;
;;;;;
"Go to the guild house and find Bastian Loudrin. Tell him about the crystal, and the rumors. Lourdrin will know what to do.""";;Elgar Fellmoon;;;
38;You must reach Bastian Loudrin in Alvar. Go! He must be informed of recent events!;;Elgar Fellmoon;;
39;This is the home of Cauri Blackthorne, greatest Dark Elf warrior.  She is currently out, working for the Merchant Council of Alvar.  Perhaps you should consult them as to her whereabouts.;;Old Dark Elf;;
40;You did all that to my guards just to deliver a letter! Let me see that…;;;;
;;;;;
…hmmm…Fellmoon wants my boats? Never! I…what!…he threatens my Irabelle…I…I…sigh…;;;;;
;;;;;
"V-very well. You can tell Fellmoon he can have my boats. I guess there's no refusing the Merchants of Alvar what they want.""";;Arion Hunter;;;
41;My cargoes are not the kind that want inspecting by harbor officials so my boats have to be, and are, the fastest on the coast of Jadame. They can even outrun a Regnan galley! From here they run west to Ravage Roaming and east to Shadowspire.;;Arion Hunter;;
42;Ancient Troll legends tell of a time when we did not live here in this desolate region.  They tell of a place that was quiet and tranquil.  We were driven from this place by the Curse of the Stone.  So for many hundred years we have dwelt here upon the Sand of Iron.  Now it seems we will be forced from this place as well.  The growing sea of fire has destroyed most of my village.  Many friends and family have perished.  This may indeed be the end of my Clan.;;;;
;;;;;
"There is a saying amongst my people, """"a thing lives only as long as it is remembered.""""  As long as I remember our homeland, then it will always be there for us to return too.  It just needs to be found.""";;TROLL PROMO;;;
43;Perhaps if you could locate our previous homeland, and check to see if the Curse of the Stone still exists.  If it does perhaps there is a way to remove it.  Any Troll in your party who completes this task would be promoted to War Troll of our Clan. Many honors are bestowed with this title, and you would be forever known to us as a legendary hero.;;;;
;;;;;
"One of our warriors, Dartin Dunewalker, set out to find this place.  He left thinking he would find clues among the stone fields of Ravage Roaming.  Perhaps you can find him there and work together--or at the least, find clues that will lead you to our goal.""";;TROLL PROMO;;;
44;The Alliance must be completed, and a unified course of action decided upon.  Return to Alvar and consult the Merchant Council.;;TROLL PROMO;;
45;You have found our Ancient Home?  Its located in the western area of the Murmurwoods?  This is wonderful news.  Perhaps there is still time to move my people.  Unfortunately the Elemental threat must be dealt with first, or no people will be safe! ;;;;
;;;;;
"All Trolls among you have been promoted to War Troll, and their names will be forever remembered in our songs.  I will teach the rest of you what skills I can, perhaps it will be enough to help you save all of Jadame.""";;TROLL PROMO;;;
46;"You were sent to find the Ancient Troll Home?  Your assistance is welcomed!  I am at a loss; the clues I followed to this region have lead to a dead end.  No one here knows about the Curse of the Stone mentioned in our legends.  The Ogre Mage, Zog was less than helpful.  I was lucky to escape his fortress with my life. ";;;;
;;;;;
"Although, he may have provided assistance with out meaning too!  When I mentioned the Curse of the Stone, he said if I bothered him further, he would be sure to cage me with his pet Basilisk!  Basilisks roam the Murmurwoods!""";;Volog Sandwind;;;
47;Thanks again for your assistance with the Basilisk curse!  Hurry back to Alvar!  We must do what we can to save Jadame.;;Cauri Blackthorne;;
48;Thanks for finding our Ancient Home, once the treat to Jadame has been handled we can begin to move there!;;TROLL PROMO;;
49;Have you found the Ancient Home for our Clan?  Without its location, my people will surely perish!;;TROLL PROMO;;
50;Disaster in Dagger Wound, too? This is indeed disturbing. If one were to believe all the rumors, one would think that all of Jadame is in upheaval and chaos.;;;;
;;;;;
I wish I knew more. I rely on our caravan masters for news, but all who were supposed to arrive here this month have not. What I do hear, troubles me. Hurricanes, floods, and now a volcano! The worst I've heard is that a sea of fire has appeared in the Ironsand Desert--and this from many sources.;;;;;
;;;;;
"I wonder if this crystal in Ravenshore has something to do with it. Its appearance at the onset of the calamity seems to be more than a coincidence.""";;Bastian Loudrin;;;
51;All of this upheaval is seriously impacting our guild's business. I need more information, but I'm being buried in gossip and rumor.;;;;
;;;;;
Many tell me of this sea of fire in the Ironsand Desert. I've heard the tale enough that I almost believe it. Confirmation or denial of the lake's existence would be of great help to me.;;;;;
;;;;;
"If you would serve me, go to the Ironsand Desert and seek this lake. If it is indeed there, find me someone who saw it appear. Bring him back here so I can hear his story myself.""";;Bastian Loudrin;;;
52;I must know more about what is going on in the Ironsand Desert. I can't use more rumors. I have enough of those already.;;;;
;;;;;
"I need you to actually go there. The desert is several days travel to the east.""";;Bastian Loudrin;;;
53;Well, so it is true. Imagine…a lake of fire. But where is my eyewitness? I need to speak with someone who saw its formation. This is important…for reasons I'm unwilling to discuss with you now.;;;;
;;;;;
"Find me someone who saw the birth of the lake of fire! Try searching the Troll village, Rust.""";;Bastian Loudrin;;;
54;You must form an alliance to stand against our threatened oblivion! Seek support from the Necromancers' Guild, Temple of the Sun, Minotaurs of Ravage Roaming, Dragons of Garrote Gorge, and the Dragon hunting party of Charles Quixote in Garrote Gorge. I'm sure that you will find it impossible to get all of them to agree to work together, but still, you must make your best effort.;;;;
;;;;;
"If we are to survive in this time of prophecy, my sages tell me that at least three of the groups I mentioned must agree to work together. Go and do this thing. If you value this world and your lives, go!""";;Bastian Loudrin;;;
55;You have done what I feared was impossible. Though these times are fraught with uncertainties, that you have united key factions of Jadame goes a long way towards securing our continued existence.;;;;
;;;;;
Well, I have done what I can. I leave the defense of the land to the alliance council. I hope they find the accommodations I have provided them in Ravenshore to be adequate--the guild house there is not our most luxurious. Still, I though it would be best if the council was located near the crystal.;;;;;
;;;;;
"I wish them, and you, good luck!""";;Bastian Loudrin;;;
56;Yes, I was here when the lake of fire first appeared. A strange gateway appeared on the desert plain outside the village. The fire you see spilled forth from it. The fire spread like water poured on the ground.;;;;
;;;;;
A wave of flames rushed over the edge of the village. Most of my people were lost instantly. What remains of this village is as you see it.;;;;;
;;;;;
"I was in the hills overlooking the village when this all happened. I saw it all, but I can hardly believe it.""";;Overdune Snapfinger;;;
57;I would come with you, If it were not for my father. So deep is his mourning for my brother, Vilebite, that he cannot care for himself.;;;;
;;;;;
My father believes that Vilebite's soul cannot rest until his remains are at rest in the village tomb. Unfortunately, Gogs infested the tomb when the lake of fire appeared.;;;;;
;;;;;
"Here! Take my brother's ashes. I'm sure my father's grief will lessen if they are placed in the tomb. Do this for me and I will travel with you to Alvar.""";;Overdune Snapfinger (add tomb details after tomb done and placed);;;
58;I will go with you only after my brother's ashes are safely in the village tomb.;;Overdune Snapfinger;;
59;You have done my family a great service. With his ashes safe in the holy sanctuary of the village tomb, Vilebite can lie in peace. My father, too is greatly improved. We have talked and I believe that he can now take care of himself while I accompany you to Alvar.;;Overdune Snapfinger;;
60;Vilebite was a good son. I will miss him. But at least I can take comfort knowing that he is at peace. Thank you for your kind and heroic deed.;;OVERDUNE'S FATHER;;
61;My father believed that the Necromancers of Shadowspire were attempting to create an undead Dragon.  This would be a truly horrid beast. He believed is was his personal duty to stop them.;;Leane Stormlance;;
62;My father Blazen, left here years ago to slay the Skeletal Dragons in the Shadowspire Region. Unfortunately, he has never returned.  He took with him, Ebonest, the greatest Dragon slaying spear ever forged. Charles Quixote has never forgiven my father for taking Ebonest with him.  Unfortunately we have no idea what befell my father.  Because my father was Charles’ second in command and responsible for the loss of Ebonest, Charles is unwilling to promote me to Champion, regardless of the merit of my skills. Perhaps if you find Ebonest, Charles with promote your knights and myself to Champions!;;Leane Stormlance;;
63;I was captured in the center of the Mad Necromancer’s lab.  There I was tortured and many curses were placed upon me.   Ebonest must have been taken from me when I fell, and perhaps is still in the central chamber.  If you were to recover it and return it to Quixote, at least my family name will be cleared, and my daughter can continue her life without my failure haunting her.;;Blazen Stormlance;;
64;Perhaps the Clerics of the Sun have a way to cure me, for they would be the only ones who would know how to counter the dark magics that afflict me. There is a friend of mine in Ravenshore named Dervish Chevron. He left the Temple of the Sun years ago to pursue his own research into the mysteries of Jadame.  Perhaps he would know of a cure, or even have it in his possession.  If he cannot help, promise you will return here and kill me so I may at last be at rest!;;Blazen Stormlance;;
65;Zanthora moved here from the Shadowspire to continue experiments she began at the Necromancers' Guild.  She desired to create the ultimate horror, the Skeletal Dragon.  Her fellow Necromancers feared the end result. If the created Dragons where ever to escape Zanthora’s control, there would be no stopping them.;;Blazen Stormlance;;
66;Blazen Stormlance was my lieutenant and my friend.  I never understood his personal quest--this need to find these rumored Skeletal Dragons.  He took my greatest tool with him.  With Ebonest in my hand, I would have the Dragon problem well in hand.  ;;Charles Quixote;;
67;The Clerics of the Sun imbued this spear with their blessings, making it the strongest spear forged.  Its power is said to be able to slay any Dragon with one blow.  If this were so, I could end my conflict quickly, cleanly and efficiently.;;Charles Quixote;;
68;"The Gem of Restoration may cure the knight, Blazen Stormlance, of what you say has befallen him.  There is no love lost between the Temple of the Sun and the Guild of Necromancers; any opponent of theirs is definitely a friend of ours.  Restore Stormlance to life so that he may rejoin Charles Quixote.";;;;
"		Dervish Chevron";;;;;
69;Have you found my father?  Or the spear Ebonest?  We must get it back to Charles Quixote!;;Leane Stormlance;;
70;You found Blazen Stormlance?  What about MY spear Ebonest?  You have that as well?;;;;
;;;;;
FANTASTIC!;;;;;
;;;;;
"I thank you for this and find myself in your debt!  I will promote all knights in your party to Champion and teach what skills I can to the rest of your party. """;;Charles Quixote;;;
71;What is this?  You ally with my mortal enemies and then seek to do me a favor?;;;;
;;;;;
I wonder what the Dragons think of this. But so be it.  I am in your debt for returning Ebonest to me.  I will promote any Knights in your party to Champion, however they will never be accepted in my service.  The rest I will teach what I can. ;;;;;
;;;;;
"I do not wish to see you again!""";;Charles Quixote;;;
72;"""An alliance to unite Jadame,"" you say. If it wasn't Lordrin who was proposing it, I would normally have slain you for my supper.";;;;
;;;;;
While intriguing, I cannot consider the idea now. We are under daily attack by the accursed knights of Charles Quixote. If he were not a problem, I could do as Lordrin asks.;;;;;
;;;;;
"Perhaps you could help me with Quixote?""";;Deftclaw Redreaver;;;
73;Last month one of Quixote's raiding parties invaded our caves. They slew many and took with them the egg containing my unborn heir. While those foul slayers hold the egg, we cannot attack their encampment.;;;;
;;;;;
"If you were to return the egg to me, I could destroy Quixote. Do this for me and I will join your alliance.""";;Deftclaw Redreaver;;;
74;If you want me to join your alliance, you will have to help me against Charles Quixote. Bring me the Dragon egg he stole from me!;;Deftclaw Redreaver;;
75;To attain the status of Great Wyrm, a Dragon must prove that he can handle himself against a great number of foes.  He must face down the vermin that Charles Quixote would send against us.  To the southwest of here, Quixote has established an encampment of his puny “Dragon Slayers.”  This camp is lead by Jeric Whistlebone, the second in command of Quixote’s army.  Destroy this camp!  Kill all of those who serve Quixote in that region and return to me.  Return to me with the sword of  Whistlebone the Slayer.  In doing this, you will prove to me your worthiness.  ;;Deftclaw Redreaver;;
76;You think I would promote a Dragon that serves those who have allied themselves with our Mortal enemy, Charles Quixote.  What arrogance!  What outrageousness!  You will have to prove yourselves to me! And in the proving you will deal a serious blow to your allies!  To the southwest of here, Quixote has established an encampment of his puny “Dragon Slayers.”  This camp is lead by Jeric Whistlebone, the second in command of Quixote’s army.  Destroy this camp!  Kill all of those who serve Quixote in that region and return to me.  Return to me with the sword of  Whistlebone the Slayer.;;Deftclaw Redreaver;;
77;"Have you slain the “Dragon Slayers?""  Where is the sword of Whistlebone the Slayer?!?";;Deftclaw Redreaver;;
78;"Have you slain the “Dragon Slayers?""  Or have you decided not to redeem yourselves in my eyes?";;Deftclaw Redreaver;;
79;You return to me with the sword of the Slayer, Whistlebone!  You are indeed worthy of my notice!  The Dragons in your group are promoted to Great Wyrm!  I will teach the others of your group what skills I can as a reward for their assistance!;;Deftclaw Redreaver;;
80;You return to me with the sword of the Slayer, Whistlebone!  Is there no end to the treachery that you will commit? Is there no one that you owe allegiance to?  I will promote those Dragons who travel with you to Great Wyrm, however they will never fly underneath me!  There rest of your traitorous group will be instructed in those skills which can be taught to them!  Go now!  Never show your face here again, unless you want it eaten!;;Deftclaw Redreaver;;
81;You have killed the Dragon Slayers, but where is the Sword of Whistlebone?  Return to me when you have it!;;Deftclaw Redreaver;;
82;Hmmm…things must be serious if trader Loudrin is involving himself in matters other than his own fortunes...and I must say that there is a taint of doom in the air.;;;;
;;;;;
If only for continued good business between my operation and his, I would normally entertain this notion of Loudrin's. Unfortunately, matters here are tying up all of my resources. I have none to spare for support of this alliance you speak of.;;;;;
;;;;;
"Say, perhaps we can help each other? If you were to take care of a little matter for me, I could consider honoring your request.""";;Charles Quixote;;;
83;"One of my customers, an Ogre that goes by the charming moniker of ""Zog the Jackal,"" has seriously betrayed my trust. I gave him an item of great value on promise of future payment. This rather large payment never arrived. I sent a messenger to demand return of the item--a Dragon's egg of great potential. This messenger was slain!";;;;
;;;;;
"Needless to say, this matter concerns me greatly. I have allotted both money and men for the purpose of revenge. If, however, you were to recover the egg for me from Zog's fortress in Ravage Roaming, I would be glad to pledge service to your alliance.""";;Charles Quixote;;;
84;Have you recovered the Dragon egg from Zog's Ravage Roaming fortress? Oh, never mind. I can see from your abashed expression that you have not.;;;;
;;;;;
"I stand firm on our deal. Bring me that egg, or I'll have nothing to do with your alliance!""";;Charles Quixote;;;
85;You have found Blazen Stormlance? But where is Ebonest?  Return to me when you have the spear and you will be promoted!;;Charles Quixote;;
86;That cursed knight, Charles Quixote is assembling his best Dragon Slayers at an encampment to the southwest of here.  He must be planning another assault upon the Dragon Caves!;;Deftclaw Redreaver;;
87;You would like my herd to join into an alliance? How could I refuse you? Not only have you saved us from certain death, we have suffered directly from the cataclysm the alliance is being created to fight!;;;;
;;;;;
"You have my pledge. With the greatest haste I myself will travel to Ravenshore to take a seat on the alliance council.""";;Masul;;;
88;It was the worst of horrors! I was on guard in the main labyrinth just north of here when the waters came. A great wave as high as my head flooded through the passages. I managed to reach this high chamber. I waited for others, but there were none. I fear that many of the herd are dead or trapped inside the lair.;;MINOTAUR CLUE GUY;;
89;Balthazar Lair has many levels. There are other chambers as high as this one., so there may be others who have survived.;;;;
;;;;;
"I have thought long on this. Though many of the tunnels are flooded, it may be possible to drain them using the doors and air vents as valves. In fact, the whole lair could be drained through the lower level escape tunnel. Help my herd! You would have our eternal gratitude.""";;MINOTAUR CLUE GUY;;;
90;I just feel it. There are still survivors of my herd trapped in the lair. If you can figure out how to drain the water from flooded passages, you may be able to reach them. Help them, I beg of you!;;MINOTAUR CLUE GUY;;
91;Balthazar, the greatest leader in the history of our herd, led our warriors in a mighty battle against the Dark Dwarf vermin that erupt from the earth and spread like a plague. It was not a battle that went well for us. Though Balthazar and some warriors escaped, many were lost along with Balthazar's Axe--his regalia of office, and a powerful artifact as well.;;Tessalar;;
92;Only Masul, our herd leader, can deem an individual worthy of the title of Minotaur Lord.  One way to prove your worth, would be to recover his father’s axe, the Axe of Balthazar from the bowels of the Mines of the Dark Dwarfs.  Set your feet upon the path of this quest, and great is you future!  But we must be sure that the axe you find is indeed the Axe of Balthazar.  Take the Axe to Dadeross, a Minotaur in the service of the Merchants of Alvar, on the island of Dagger Wound.  He will be able to verify the truth of what you find.;;Tessalar;;
93;These little vermin work with or for the Elements of the Earth.  No one can tell which.  They burrow up from the earth in search of wealth, food, and slaves.  Nothing is left behind where these scavengers have been.;;Tessalar;;
94;You have found the Axe of Balthazar!  Have you presented it to Dadeross?  Without his authentication, we can not proceed with the Rite’s of Purity!  Find him and return to us once you have presented him with the axe!;;Tessalar;;
95;You have found the Axe of Balthazar!  Have you presented it to Dadeross? Ah, you have authentication from Dadeross!  The Rite’s of Purity will begin immediately! You proven yourselves worthy, and our now members of our herd!  The Minotaurs who travel with you are promoted to Minotaur Lord.  The others in your group will be taught what skills we have that maybe useful to them.;;Tessalar;;
96;It was my pleasure to serve under Lord Balthazar, he was the finest herd leader in my tribe’s history.  Unfortunately, my services were pledged to the Merchants of Alvar, or I may have been in the battle where Balthazar fell.  Perhaps my ability and my axe could have saved my lord.  We’ll never know now.;;Dadeross;;
97;Of course I would know Balthazar's Axe if I saw it!  Do you have it with you? This IS the axe!  You must take this back to Tessalar, so the Rite’s of Purity may be performed upon the axe, so it be made ready for the son of Balthazar, Masul.  Take this letter with you, it carries my personal seal, and statement that this is indeed the Axe of Balthazar!;;Dadeross;;
98;Where is Balthazar's Axe?  You waste my time!  Find the axe, find Dadeross and return to me!;;Tessalar;;
99;Thank you for returning the Axe of Balthazar to us!  When we complete the Rites of Purity, we will present the axe to Masul. It will then be known as the Axe of Masul and surely Masul will be a wise and just herd leader.;;Tessalar;;
100;Of course I would know Balthazar's Axe if I saw it!  Do you have it with you?  If you find it, return to me so that I may certify that it is indeed the axe of my late lord, Balthazar.;;Dadeross;;
101;You have found Balthazar's Axe and I have authenticated it!  Hurry back to Tessalar so that the Rites of Purity may begin!;;Dadeross;;
102;Ah, you returned Balthazar's Axe with my certificate to Tessalar!  The Rites of Purity have begun.  Soon Lord Masul will wield his father's axe as his own!  Greatness will return to my herd!;;Dadeross;;
103;Of the many Prophecies of Jadame, the only ones that I have not be studied are the Prophecies of the Sun.  This temple was established by Tesius Dawnglow, who traveled here from Erathia many years ago to find these Prophecies.  Unfortunately, they were not found.  It is our hope that these Prophecies hold the solution to the events that are destroying Jadame.;;Verish;;
104;I know that the Prophecies can be found in the Lair of the Feathered Serpent.  However, I have no idea what that means, thus the clue is no help to me. ;;Verish;;
105;You seek promotion for the clerics of our faith who travel with you.?  I can promote you, but I do not place much trust or faith in strangers these days.  If you were to do something for me, such as finding the lost Prophecies of the Sun, and returning them to me, then I would be agreeable to promoting you.;;Verish;;
106;Have you found this Lair of the Feathered Serpent and the Prophecies of the Sun?  Do not waste my time!  The world is ending and you waste time with useless conversation!  Return to me when you have found the Prophecies and have taken them to the Temple of the Sun.;;Verish;;
107;You have found the lost Prophecies of the Sun?  May the Light forever shine upon you and may the Prophet guide your steps.  With these we may be able to find the answer to what has befallen Jadame! ;;Verish;;
108;You return. True to your word, you have located the Prophecies of the Sun and taken them to my brothers in the Temple of the Sun.  you are truly worthy, and with the Sun’s blessing I will promote the clerics who travel with you.  After, I will teach the rest of your group what skills I can as their reward.;;Verish;;
109;Korbu was the most powerful of the Vampire race.  Over one hundred years ago, he sought something that our kind cannot accept.  Absolution.  Somehow, Korbu began to experience guilt over the need to feed.  Or perhaps over the act of feeding itself.  He could no longer bear the thought of killing in order to survive.  Many of our elders argued with him.  He decided to find a place where he could ponder his existence.  Thus the Crypt of Korbu was constructed with slave labor in the Ravage Roaming region.   Korbu has not been heard from since he left.  ;;Lathean;;
110;In this time of chaos, we need the minds of all our elders.  Return to us with Korbu, or his remains, if he has perished.  If he has indeed perished, you must return his Sarcophagus with him.  We will attempt to reanimate him so that we may consult his wisdom.;;Lathean;;
111;You return to us with the remains of Korbu, but where is his Sarcophagus? We cannot complete the act of reanimation without it!  Return to us when you have both the remains and the Sarcophagus!;;Lathean;;

113;Ah, you seek to achieve the ultimate in the darker arts.  The necromancer’s among you seek to turn themselves into Liches, the most potent of necromancers.  Very well, I can perform this transformation for you, but you must do something for me...and get something for yourselves.  I require the Lost Book of Khel.  It contains secrets of necromancy that had been hidden since Khel’s tower sank beneath the waves.  The Lizardmen of Dagger Wound celebrated when the sea took Khel and his knowledge from us.  With the volcanic upheaval in that region, I believe the Tower of Khel can be found.  Retrieve the book from the library and bring it to me!  Now, for yourselves, you will need a Lich Jar for every necromancer that wishes to become a Lich.  Zanthora, the Mad Necromancer keeps a large supply of these jars, perhaps she will sell you one!  If not you must take them from her!;;Vetrinus Taleshire;;
114;You have the Lost Book of Khel, however you lack the Lich Jars needed to complete the transformation!  Return here when you have one for each necromancer in your party!;;Vetrinus Taleshire;;
115;You do not have the Lost Book of Khel!  I cannot help you, if you do not help me!  Return here with the Book and a Lich Jar for each necromancer in your party that wishes to become a Lich!;;Vetrinus Taleshire;;
116;You have brought everything needed to perform the transformation!  So be it!  All necromancer’s in your party will be transformed into Liches!  May the dark energies flow through them for all eternity!  The rest of you will gain what knowledge I can teach them as reward for their assistance!  Lets begin!;;;;
;;;;;
"After we have completed, good friend Lathean can handle any future promotions for your party.""";;Vetrinus Taleshire;;;
117;You have brought us the Sarcophagus of Korbu and his sacred remains.  We will attempt to reanimate Korbu and seek his wisdom in these troubled times!  The vampires among you will be transformed into Nosferatu, and the others will be taught what skills we can teach them as reward for your service.;;Lathean;;

150;The Lost Book of Khel will advance my skills in the dark arts beyond that of even Sandro!  I am forever in your debt!;;Vetrinus Taleshire;;
151;We need to consult Korbu!  You have agreed to bring us his remains and his Sarcophagus!  Do not bother us until you have these items!;;;;
152;Korbu?  He was the greatest of our kind, and yet he always seemed troubled.  There are some of us that remember the times before he left. He always seemed disturbed to me.;;;;
153;"Korbu left us after making the ""Arrangement"" with the necromancers here in Shadowspire.  We aid them in any research they are working on, and assist with the defense of their guild.  In return we are allowed to feed on the local population without hindrance.";;;;
154;The Guild of Necromancers is very stingy when it comes to parting with Lich Jars.  You may be better off seeking out Zanthora, and obtaining one from her.;;;;
155;the Lost Book of Khel is rumored to hold the secrets to the ultimate powers of the dark art of necromancy.  It may be good that no one knows where it is!;;;;
156;Bastian Loudrin has been a great friend to the guild. Sadly, I must refuse his request at this time. Even as we speak, my guild is embroiled in a battle for its very survival. For you see, the Temple of the Sun has declared a holy war on us. Most of our members are away in the fields either leading armies or raising zombies to serve in them.;;;;
;;;;;
"I wish I could say otherwise, but the accursed temple holds the upper hand. If only the balance would tilt in our favor.""";;Sandro;;;
157;If we had the Nightshade Brazier back in our possession, Shadowspire's defense would not be an issue. We could bring this war to the doors of the Sun Temple. We would annihilate them!;;;;
;;;;;
Knowing its importance, the clerics keep the brazier in a secure chamber deep within their temple. Dyson Leland believes he can gain access to that chamber. Bring him to the temple, recover the brazier and return it to me. You want me in your alliance? Well, do this for me, and I will be in your debt.;;;;;
;;;;;
"If you have any questions about the Nightshade Brazier ask Thant. It was he who created the thing.""";;Sandro;;;
158;I will not join you until the security of the guild is secure. Bring me the Nightshade Brazier from the Temple of the Sun in Murmurwoods. We will talk again of alliance after that is done.;;Sandro;;
159;Early on our conflict, the Sun Temple attempted to infiltrate our ranks with a spy. Such foolishness--thinking they could so easily deceive a host of dark magicians!;;;;
;;;;;
"It was child's play to unmask their agent--one """"Dyson Leland."""" Since then we have turned him against his former masters, or so it would seem. Frankly, I don't entirely trust in his loyalty. Still, he has proven useful. As long as he does, we will continue to let him live.""";;Sandro;;;
160;"How can anyone's quest for power bring him to participate in the horrors of the Dark Path? And yet, here is a whole house of them! Oh, they will call themselves ""seekers of knowledge,"" but these magicians of death are abomination! Loathsome corruption incarnate!";;;;
;;;;;
"Only through my own fear can the foul Necromancers' Guild call itself """"my master.""""""";;Dyson Leland;;;
161;When I was young, all I wanted to do was to join the Order of Light--to be a selfless servant of the good. As soon as I was of age, I entered the Temple of the Sun with a heart filled with the fire of purity.;;;;
;;;;;
"What a fool I was. If there is goodness in the world, I have not seen it. There is certainly none in the halls of the Sun Temple! Hiding behind the righteousness of sanctity, Order members perform the worst crimes of greed and self-indulgence. If it were not so horrid, it would pass for something like irony.""";;Dyson Leland;;;
162;"A few months ago, I was called to a private audience with the Sun Temple head priest, Oskar Tyre. He sent me out on a mission of infiltration against the Necromancers' Guild. ""Become as they are,"" he said. ""Gain their trust. While you bide your time waiting to deliver a killing blow, feed us their secrets.""";;;;
;;;;;
"A too simple plan from too simple a leader! Oh, I did as he said, bathing myself in evil so I might seem evil. But it was as if the guild could see into my heart. I was unmasked as a spy. Under threat of death, I now follow their orders. """;;Dyson Leland;;;
163;Join with you? An interesting idea. But what can you offer me? After all I have been through I find myself consumed with a thirst for revenge. I would go with you, but am unwilling to spend my efforts lightly. Give me an opportunity to hurt one of my enemies--the cursed Temple of the Sun or the abominable Necromancers' Guild--and I will travel with you gladly.;;Dyson Leland;;
164;Now that the Nightshade Brazier covers Shadowspire in its fortifying darkness. Thant goes to lead his minions.;;Sandro;;
165;Certainly the elemental unrest concerns us greatly. Why one need travel only a short distance north from our temple to see a great maelstrom of unnatural duration and fury. But sadly we have other matters pressing.;;;;
;;;;;
"The sick horror that is the Necromancers' Guild must be blighted from this land! We wage holy war on the evil in Shadowspire. Our entire spirit and power goes into the campaign we wage against Sandro and his minions. Until that is done we cannot entertain participation in your alliance.""";;Oskar Tyre;;;
166;Then again, we could spare some resources for your alliance if the war would turn in our favor. Perhaps you could be our agent of fortune?;;;;
;;;;;
"Inside the Necromancers' Guild is a device known as the """"Skeleton Transformer."""" It converts living creatures into the skeletons which the dark mages use for the bulk of their reinforcements. If it were destroyed, we would quickly have the upper hand.";;;;;
;;;;;
"We have an agent, Dyson Leland, placed in their guild. Find him and help him to wreck their skeleton making device. Do this and I will consider your request more favorably.""";;Oskar Tyre;;;
167;You come here again with talk of alliance? I have told you what you must do. Go to the Necromancers' Guild in Shadowspire, find Dyson Leland and help him to destroy their Skeleton Transformer!;;Oskar Tyre;;
168;Excellent work! With the Skeleton Transformer destroyed, I am more than confident that the light of righteousness will cleanse Shadowspire of evil. The Necromancers' Guild is as good as no more.;;;;
;;;;;
"As I agreed, you may now consider the Temple of the Sun an ally against the elemental cataclysm. I myself will sit on your alliance council in Ravenshore. I will make my departure arrangements with all due haste.""";;Oskar Tyre;;;
169;Do you take the prophecy so lightly that you shirk the role it has cast for you? These are dire times calling for dire actions from all. Go forth across the land and forge the unity represented by the alliance. Go, unless you favor the oblivion that threatens us!;;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;
170;Using Arion Hunter's boats we have managed to gather some information. I sent one to Ravage Roaming and another to the Dagger Wound Islands. It is reported that strange portal gateways have appeared in both regions. The gateway in the islands stands on the slopes of the large volcano that rose from the sea southeast of the main island. The Ravage Roaming portal is in the middle of the large lake. It is said that the water which formed the lake flooded out of the gateway.;;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;
171;Within hours of our first meeting, a most fortuitous development occurred. We were contacted by a great sage, Xanthor, of the Ironfist courts of Enroth!;;;;
;;;;;
"Using his great magic, he projected his image into this very chamber. He and Roland and Catherine Ironfist were at sea off our shores when the cataclysm occurred. They survived the resulting storms and now would like to land in Ravenshore to aid the alliance. Unfortunately, they are blocked by the Regnan pirate fleet. We must help them to land. Xanthor claims much knowledge of what has happened here. We need his council!""";;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;;
172;Our sources believe the main Regnan fleet is in a hidden port somewhere on Regna Island. If you could sink the fleet in dock you could greatly cripple their ability to patrol the seas off our shore. Unfortunately, we don't have a fleet of our own strong enough to make a landing on Regna.;;;;
;;;;;
Brekish Onefang has gotten message to us that the Regnans have built an outpost on an atoll off the main Dagger Wound Island. He believes this outpost is resupplied by mysterious means. His scouts never see ships land there, but they are always well stocked. Perhaps you should go there and solve the mystery. Perhaps the answer will convey you to Regna?;;;;;
;;;;;
"Regardless of the means, the Regnan fleet must be sunk if the Ironfists are to land in Ravenshore.""";;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;;
173;Your good work sinking the Regnan fleet has already had the desired results. Just yesterday morning, Catherine and Roland Ironfist arrived along with their sage, Xanthor. With them in the alliance, we are made stronger--immeasurably so.;;;;
;;;;;
"I will admit that the time of this crisis has contained some of my darkest moments. Thanks to your efforts I believe that the worst of this is over. I have hopes that we will indeed survive this.""";;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;;
174;You must sink that Regnan fleet! It is imperative that the Ironfists be allowed to land safely. Their sage Xanthor has knowledge of the crisis that we cannot do without.;;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;
175;For all their claims of empire and their airs of civilization, the Regnans are the worst scum of Jadame. Why I cannot find myself the least bit surprised that they would take advantage of the crisis to expand their pirating operations. What concerns me most is their new outpost on Dagger Wound. I am sure they mean to use it as a base of attack on the continent. Why, it even puts them in striking distance of Ravenshore!;;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;
176;I have only met with him briefly, but I am convinced that Xanthor is remarkably knowledgeable about the workings of the elemental planes. Apparently he learned much from the Ironfists' elemental allies during their recent campaigns against the devils of Erathia.;;;;
;;;;;
"Even now he studies the strange crystal in the town square. You may find him there, or perhaps in the nearby residence we have provided him.""";;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;;
177;We of the council have great faith in this Xanthor. He has told me that he is formulating a plan for dealing with the elemental crisis. If anyone can find a solution to our problems, it is he.;;;;
;;;;;
"If you would help us further, be of service to this great sage. Consult with him about the crystal and see what you might do for him.""";;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;;
178;We look to Xanthor to formulate our next actions. Go to him and see how you can help.;;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;
179;That we have been joined by the royal court of Enroth has been nothing but good. I was worried they would be afflicted with the need for pomp which infects many other monarchs. I am gladdened to report that this is not the case with this king and queen. They disembarked and set directly to work on our problem. As key members of our alliance, you will find access to them easy. We have put them up in houses here in Ravenshore.;;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;
180;From what Xanthor has told us, I'm sure all of the elemental planes are dangerous. Still, I would advise you to take particular caution when exploring the Plane of Fire. Its denizens, according to reports from the Ironsand Desert, are being particularly belligerent.;;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;
181;All I know of the Plane Between Planes is what I learned from the Alvarian loremasters. Still, if the Destroyer's base is there, proceed with the greatest caution! It is said the plane is made of the stuff of chaos from which all the other planes are formed as if from clay. While chaos has a form, it is fluid. Whatever you see there will not be as it seems. And what is there may be subject to continuous change.;;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;
182;What the Alvar loremasters told me of the Plane Between Planes applies here. While I am sure the prisons of the elemental lords are prisons in every sense of the word, I am equally sure that they will not appear as one would expect.;;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;
183;The Merchant Guild of Alvar owes you a great debt. As a small measure of repayment, we have decided to make this merchanthouse permanently available to you. Please take this gift from us as a token of our profound gratitude for your valorous deeds.;;Elgar Fellmoon NPC 53;;
184;I know being part of your alliance is important work. Still, I do miss the hunt! I keep imagining all the good fun my men are having while I'm here pushing around papers.;;;;
;;;;;
"Hurry up with this alliance business! I want to get this mess taken care of with dispatch! Without the thrill of the hunt, my life is missing its usual spark.""";;Charles Quixote NPC 65;;;
185;"Judging from the tactics employed by the Regnan pirates, I suspect that Blackwell Cooper is involved. Cooper is an old…shall we say, ""associate,"" of mine. Why, if I were a gambling man, I'd bet gold that he is leading the Regnan expeditionary force on Dagger Wound.";;Charles Quixote NPC 65;;
186;I know I hold the council's minority opinion on the subject, but really, I don't see why we have to involve some charlatan magician in this matter! Surely this crisis is solvable, like most things, with judicious application of a length of well-forged steel.;;Charles Quixote NPC 65;;
187;Fah! If you ask me, this idea of Xanthor's is foolhardy! I say if we're facing attack by elemental armies, we should be raising an army to meet them. Frankly, all this talk of prophecy leaves me uneasy. This council is too much under the sway of the Ironfist's pet wizard. I say we take the fight to the elemental planes and introduce the invaders to the sharp edges of our blades!;;Charles Quixote NPC 65;;
188;"I tell you, this Xanthor is sending you on a wild goose chase. ""Plane Between Planes,"" indeed! What hogwash! The worst of it is that we make no preparations for war in the event the crazy scheme fails, which I expect it will. This mad following of prophecy flies in the face of good military sense!";;Charles Quixote NPC 65;;
189;I have had more of my share of doubts about this Xanthor, but it is the mark of a man how readily he admits his errors. It is clear to me now that he has given nothing but good and effective advise. If he tells you to rescue the elemental lords, then that is what you must do. Go! And good luck!;;Charles Quixote NPC 65;;
190;Good to see you again, Heroes of Jadame. A good job there, saving the world, and all. You certainly have my thanks, and I'm sure, the thanks of many.;;;;
;;;;;
"I'm sure you've got plenty of other opportunities at this point, but let me know if you want a job hunting Dragons. Probably not much of a challenge for the likes of you, but the offer stands!""";;Charles Quixote NPC 65;;;
191;Small ones, hurry with your alliance preparations! My patience with this land lacking in caves and prey grows dangerously thin. Not only must I sleep in a barn, these people do not even raise cattle. I must live off of fish! Fah!;;;;
;;;;;
"If you value my good temper, be quick!""";;Deftclaw Redreaver NPC 66;;;
192;Reaching Regna Island is no small challenge. One of my scouts has reported to me that Regnan boats lie thick on the sea. He also said he saw that the Regnans have a craft that can travel beneath the water. It is said they supply their Dagger Wound outpost with the craft. Perhaps you can use it to reach Regna. The pirates will either miss your passage or take you for one of their own.;;Deftclaw Redreaver NPC 66;;
193;"I know this is not the time to think of revenge, but I would pass onto you something I learned about my enemy, Charles Quixote.

550;I am pleased with these Ironfists and their sage, Xanthor. Though we have never worked together directly, their work in Enroth and Erathia against the Necromancers' Guild and the devils have clearly marked them as servants of The Light. I have full faith in their plans for saving us from the crisis.;;Oskar Tyre NPC 67;;
551;The Sun Temple has had much time to study the gateway which appeared in Murmurwoods. I am positive it leads to the Plane of Air. On several occasions my brothers have seen air spirits around the gateway. Some of the braver have peered through it and have reported seeing a whirling realm of clouds.;;Oskar Tyre NPC 67;;
552;As a Priest of the Light, I have my own ideas about the source of the crisis. I am positive that either the Temple of the Moon or the Necromancers' Guild is somehow involved. Great Light! What if they've banded together? What a horrid thought.;;Oskar Tyre NPC 67;;
553;"I'm not sure you can trust the words of this so called, ""Destroyer."" Certainly he is not the Destroyer of scripture. And all this talk of Kreegans and men living on many worlds. It flies in the face of the Truth my temple has shepherded from the beginning of time!";;Oskar Tyre NPC 67;;
554;It is good to have you with us, Heroes of Jadame. Know that the Temple of the Sun also considers you servants of the Light. You are always welcome among us.;;Oskar Tyre NPC 67;;
555;I wish my first visit to Ravenshore was made under better circumstances. This town has a lot to offer and I wish I had time to explore it more. On the bright side, this merchant house has a great library. Have you seen it?;;Masul NPC 68;;
556;The Regnans have built and outpost on one of the Dagger Wound Islands. We fear they may attack Ravenshore. If this happens, we will evacuate the city. We will return once the garrison has rid Ravenshore of pirates.;;Masul NPC 68;;
557;When I became herd leader, I never expected my reign would be so full of rich experience. Certainly I never thought I'd meet anyone like Queen Catherine! Did you know that until she abdicated her rule in Erathia, she was ruler of both it and Enroth?;;Masul NPC 68;;
558;As you know, the gateway leading to the Plane of Water appeared near Balthazar Lair in Ravage Roaming. It lies in the middle of the lake created by the great flood that poured forth from it.;;Masul NPC 68;;
559;You may have difficulty finding supplies in the lands beyond the crystal. When I left Balthazar Lair, I brought with me a quantity of the iron rations carried by my armies on campaign. Here, take what I have. They are light and nourishing. I hope you find them useful.;;Masul NPC 68;;
560;Why if the imprisonment of the elemental lords is what started this crisis, then surely releasing them is the way to end it! They are beings of almost unimaginable power. Once freed of the Destroyer's control, they would be able to set things right again. This must be what the prophecy speaks of!;;Masul NPC 68;;
561;It cannot be said enough. My herd as well as all the beings of Jadame are forever in your debt. Thanks to your good work here and in the planes, Balthazar Lair can once again know greatness. You and your comrades are welcome here any time you wish to visit. A blessing on you all!;;Masul NPC 68;;
562;I can't help feeling that I could be doing better work elsewhere. I'm sure Thant can handle operation of the guild in my absence, but still, sitting here on my hands while we are at war with the Sun Temple tries my patience. You really must be quicker about your duties!;;Sandro NPC 69;;
563;"When one thinks of the Regnans, the phrase ""masters of magic"" doesn't normally come to mind. But I caution you, the Regnan pirates have held their island for many centuries. They have had much time to both acquire and study arcane knowledge. Some powerful magicians live there. If you must face them in combat, be prepared for anything.";;Sandro NPC 69;;
564;It is not true that we of the Necromancers' Guild do not respect mages of other schools. That they have chosen paths leading to lesser powers is of their own concerns. This Xanthor is formidable for a wizard not of the Dark Path. As much as is possible, I find his advise, passably worthy.;;Sandro NPC 69;;
565;I have learned that the Dark Dwarves of Alvar hold an item I have long coveted, but may be of particular use to you if you when you travel among the elemental planes. The Ring of Planes conveys upon its wearer powerful wards against damaging spells of earth, water, air, and fire.;;Sandro NPC 69;;
566;In my studies I have learned something of this Plane Between Planes. It is written that its denizens are not born in the normal fashion. I have heard that creatures can be found there which manifest the energies of the nightmare dreams of humankind. I have little more information, but I imagine such a creature would be both powerful and malevolent.;;Sandro NPC 69;;
567;A basic fact of magic is that Fire opposes Water, and Air opposes Earth. Within these parings, the one element has weaknesses regarding its opposite element. I expect the Destroyer exploits this principle in the construction of his prisons.;;Sandro NPC 69;;
568;I know I speak for the guild when I say we owe you a debt of gratitude. I discharge this debt by granting you and your companions safe passage through all lands under our control. No guild member will kidnap you for arcane experimentation, nor will any member consider you feed for his servants, living or otherwise. This guild edict will be in effect for a period of one year from today.;;;;
;;;;;
"And of course, you have my personal, thanks.""";;Sandro NPC 69;;;
569;The master is not here at present. He went to consult with Elgar Fellmoon at the council chamber. Perhaps you will find him there.;;XANTHOR's LACKEY NPC 77;;
570;The crystal placed by the Destroyer in the town square serves two functions. One, if we do nothing, it will destroy the world. Two, it acts as a gateway to another realm of existence--the Plane Between Planes--where the Destroyer most certainly has his base.;;;;
;;;;;
"The crystal calls forth the elemental forces into our world and draws them to it. When these forces meet here at the crystal, the world will be destroyed in cataclysm. If we are to prevent this someone will have to use the crystal as a gateway to reach the Destroyer and either convince him to end his assault, or eliminate him.""";;XANTHOR NPC 23;;;
571;Since the crystal is attuned to the elemental forces, it will only pass through those who are themselves so attuned. I believe it is possible to create a key that will simulate attunement for a small group such as yourselves. I can make the key, but require components of pure elemental forces to do so.;;;;
;;;;;
"Such components exist in only one form that I know of. On each of the four elemental planes, you will find gemstones called the """"elemental hearts."""" Bring these to me and I will build the key to open the crystal gateway.""";;XANTHOR NPC 23;;;
572;To go through the crystal gateway and confront the Destroyer, you need the key I must build! To build this key, I need the elemental heart gemstones from the four elemental planes! Go and get these for me!;;XANTHOR NPC 23;;
573;I am glad that you have had some measure of success in retrieving the elemental hearts, but what you have is not enough. I need one from each of the four elemental planes before I can build the key to the crystal gateway. Bring me the rest of the hearts so we can proceed.;;XANTHOR NPC 23;;
574;Something about this crystal seems to put a compulsion on the denizens of the elemental planes. Why else would they make war on our plane? I have heard yours and other first hand reports. It seems almost as if these elementals are driven by a madness.;;;;
;;;;;
"And madness it is! For destroying Enroth would create a mighty planar unbalance which would certainly victimize their own planes. They might even conceivably be themselves destroyed in the cataclysm. At the very least, they risk changing the nature of their own planes. I cannot see how such change could possibly be for the better!""";;XANTHOR NPC 23;;;
575;That the elemental lords are imprisoned on the Plane Between Planes explains much. I had wondered why the denizens of the Earth, Air, Water, and Fire Planes have become so hostile. Usually, they are content to keep to their own place in the order. I suppose it was necessary for the Destroyer to take the lords from their homelands. Without the lords calming presence, it would be much easier for him to compel the elementals as he has.;;;;
;;;;;
"It is important for you to free the elemental lords. They can restore order to their planes and prevent the cataclysm!""";;XANTHOR NPC 23;;;
576;"Yes, I have heard the name, ""Escaton."" He is variously called in the legends of many cultures. I know not his nature, but it is his purpose to destroy worlds.";;;;
;;;;;
"Yes, """"worlds,"""" I say. More and more evidence points to the conclusion that Enroth is not the only place in this universe where there is life. Tales from before the Silence speak of many living among the stars. Yes, it sounds impossible to think that one could live on a light in the sky, but consider that these stars may be like our sun. If this is so, then why can't these suns shine on other places like Enroth? If this was the case, then there could be a """"destroyer of worlds."""" I believe that this is what we face.""";;XANTHOR NPC 23;;;
577;No, I don't think I will be leaving when the Ironfists continue their journey back to Enroth. Perhaps I will join with them in some years, but for now, I find myself fascinated by these lands. Though it is destroyed, I would study the remains of the crystal gateway. Never in my knowledge has there been in this world an artifact of comparable power. Perhaps I will find some use for the crystal shards?;;;;
;;;;;
"No matter. Regardless, when the Ironfists go, they will go without me.""";;XANTHOR NPC 23;;;
578;Without false modesty I must say that the Nightshade Brazier is the greatest creation of my dark arts. When its fires are properly tended, the accursed sun is incapable of shining within its area of influence. The soothing shadow of night takes up permanent residence over a vast region. Within these boundaries, vampires and other night creatures know freedoms they would not otherwise know. We are free of the crypts with no worries of the destroying light of day!;;;;
;;;;;
"And now the Temple of the Sun has taken my prize. It must be retrieved!""";;Thant NPC 10;;;
579;"I am Escaton the Destroyer also called ""Devil's Doom,"" ""The Spider in the Web Gate"" and ""Ruin."" There are places where I am worshiped as a god. But to myself I think of myself only as a servant to my greater masters.";;;;
;;;;;
"Know too that I have brought the cataclysm to your world, which must be destroyed. It is a doom you have brought on yourselves by failing to eliminate the devil Kreegans from your realms. """;;Escaton;;;
580;My masters are those who created me. They gave me form and function. I have thus proven indestructible. I destroy worlds infested by Kreegans.;;Escaton;;
581;On your world they speak of a Silence which has lasted for a thousand years and more. I am old beyond that and my masters are ancient to me.;;Escaton;;
582;There are more worlds than yours--a myriad of them. These worlds were once held in a great web whose threads could be traversed like bridges over rivers. What you call the Silence was marked by the breaking of the web which was built by my masters.;;Escaton;;
583;At one time my ancient masters were caretakers of more worlds than there are apples in a bushel. Before the Kreegans--before the Silence--they were worlds of wonder. My masters were kings and queens of a golden civilization. I was made, not because I was needed, but because I could be made--a protector of that which needed no protection...a symbol of might to a mighty people.;;;;
;;;;;
"But now, and for a millennium, the Kreegan blight has eaten away the splendor of the worlds. And so have my masters fallen. They are warlords and generals, and I am their greatest soldier.""";;Escaton;;;
584;Your world will be destroyed by the elemental forces that created it. The crystal in Jadame's central city compels those who live on the elemental planes to open their worlds onto yours. When their worlds meet at the crystal, the reaction will unleash irrepressible destruction across the lands, sky and sea. All things living will live no longer.;;Escaton;;
585;The cataclysm was brought into being when I performed the ritual Convocation of Cataclysm which brought into being the crystal. It is a weapon of last resort created by my masters to defend themselves against the Kreegans.;;;;
;;;;;
"I do have other weapons. But when I became aware of the Kreegans infestation on your world, I deemed the use of ultimate force necessary. Your world has fallen so far--it seemed certain you would not be able to defend yourselves against my enemies. Though I underestimated your abilities, and the Kreegans were ultimately destroyed, I still feel that I was right to err on the side of caution.""";;Escaton;;;
586;My masters, afraid the Kreegans would learn ways to corrupt me, have made me incorruptible. I am unable to undo the Convocation of Cataclysm once it has been performed. This command of theirs is part of my very being. I am powerless but to obey.;;Escaton;;
587;"The Convocation of Cataclysm, as powerful as it is, cannot of itself destroy a world. Each of the elemental planes is ruled by a lord. These lords can fight the compulsion placed on their lesser subjects. For this reason, I have removed the lords from their realms. They are my ""guests"" for the time being.";;;;
;;;;;
"Once the cataclysm has run its course, I will return them so that they might rebuild your realm and theirs.""";;Escaton;;;
588;"In the time since the Silence, your world has lost knowledge of the Kreegan's origin. That they resemble the devils of myth has been enough for you, and indeed, ""devils"" is what most call them. The truth is they came from the beyond. Before they attacked us, my masters had no knowledge of them.";;;;
;;;;;
"The Kreegans infest our worlds and spread if they can. It would seem in an endless universe that they could expand in another direction than ours. But they have not made this choice so we must defend ourselves from them.""";;Escaton;;;
589;I am aware that the king and queen of Enroth have rid your world of Kreegans. Still, your world is to be destroyed. Once I am called, I must perform the Convocation. Once the Convocation is begun, it must continue.;;;;
;;;;;
"I was called while Kreegan still lived on your world. It matters not that they were dust by the time I arrived.""";;Escaton;;;
590;"If it were not for the Kreegans and the state of war they impose, my masters could rebuild the Web of Worlds and lift what you call ""The Silence."" My masters have attempted to rebuild the Web many times, but the Kreegans always destroy it. Now they have concluded that the Kreegans must be entirely eliminated or the golden civilization will never rise again. It is to fulfill this purpose that I have been created.";;Escaton;;
591;As far as I'm able to feel such, I am amazed that your world was able to eliminate its Kreegan infestation. They are quite a bit more…advanced than you. The king and queen of Enroth must be strategists of the highest order. Too bad that they were not able to finish their task sooner.;;;;
;;;;;
"If I could regret, I would regret having to needlessly annihilate your world.""";;Escaton;;;
592;Yes, your world does need saving! The cataclysm, if not stopped, will destroy it utterly.;;;;
;;;;;
A quandary for you: I, as bringer of the cataclysm know how it can be ended. Further, I acknowledge that since there are no longer Kreegans on your world it need not be destroyed. But, as servant to my masters, I am compelled to let the cataclysm continue by not divulging my knowledge to you.;;;;;
;;;;;
"Still I will ask you some questions. Perhaps there is something for you in the answers?""";;Escaton;;;
593;Though I must destroy your world, what I need do I have already done. Until the cataclysm has culminated, there is nothing to stop me from indulging you with my conversation. This cannot continue forever. Nothing does.;;;;
;;;;;
"Sometimes questions create more questions. Sometimes they provide answers. I wonder what my questions will provide you?""";;Escaton;;;
594;My masters have made me a holder, and not a giver, of knowledge. Still perhaps you have given yourself knowledge through my questions? I have given you all the questions I will, so you must look at what you have. Perhaps you should question the answers.;;;;
;;;;;
"A """"prison"""" implies a prisoner. Who? """"Inside?"""" Inside of what? And """"egg."""" What kind of egg? A bird's egg? Perhaps something like an egg?""";;Escaton;;;
595;Where does one serve to pay,;;;;
  Is not free to leave,;;;;;
"  But is free when one leaves?""";;Escaton;;;
596;Yes. Your answer seems to fit the riddle nicely. Perhaps that is the correct answer.;;Escaton;;
597;That doesn't seem right at all.;;Escaton;;
598;"Jails, prisons and cells come in many forms. We hear of so called ""prisons of the mind."" But I wonder. The riddle seems to speak of a physical prison. What think you?";;Escaton;;
599;What is there when;;;;
  You enter a room,;;;;;
  And cannot be outside,;;;;;
"  Though you leave the door open?""";;Escaton;;;
600;The vagaries of language are many. Still, your answer seems to apply well to the question.;;Escaton;;
601;I suppose that could work…no, on second thought, it seems entirely wrong.;;Escaton;;
602;Inside. Inside what? And what is inside? And while we're asking...why?;;Escaton;;
603;A moon colored box;;;;
  meant to be opened from the inside;;;;;
  protects the sun colored;;;;;
  treasure of life.;;;;;
"  What is it?""";;Escaton;;;
604;What else indeed could the answer be? I'm sure if one were to apply some thought, one could think of something. Still in these matters, it is best to have confidence in one's clearest thought. I suppose your answer could be correct.;;Escaton;;
605;I don't see how that could be the answer. Really I can't.;;Escaton;;
606;"""Egg,"" yes. or perhaps, ""eggs."" Eggs are a source of life, a seed of sorts. They are also of an unusual shape not found in many places elsewhere. Perhaps placing the answer in context will give a clue or some direction.";;Escaton;;
607;I would judge that you've answered the riddles correctly. I suppose in asking them to you I have in some way helped you. As far as I and my nature are concerned, this is sufficient.;;;;
;;;;;
"As a reward for your performance, take this small bauble. I have more than one and therefore, more than I require. And see? I can give it to you because I don't know you have the knowledge to use it.""";;Escaton;;;
608;Thank you for releasing me. I go now to restore order to my realm and to do what I can for yours. Know that Shalwend, Lord of Air, holds you in his favor. Farewell.;;Shalwend;;
609;"""The Destroyer"" is a fitting moniker for one who would imprison me in such a fashion. If it were not for you, I, Acwalander, Lord of Water, would have soon perished. My passing would have had an unbalancing effect across all the planes. Thank you. I go now to set things right.";;Acwalander;;
610;"I am free! Now will he who was fool enough to jail me--this Destroyer--feel my wrath. That I, the Lord of Earth, am called ""Gralkor the Cruel"" is no mistake. The suffering I have felt will be his returned in multitudes!";;Gralkor;;
611;Free at last. My torment is over, but what of my subjects? I know the Destroyer has them compelled to a terrible task. My presence will sooth them. I must go. I must…farewell…;;Pyrannaste;;
612;No! Someone must remain here to guard the lair against the barbarian raiders. Come back after you've helped my herd. I may consider joining you then.;;Thanys;;
613;There are many predators who would take advantage of the lair in this vulnerable time. I've already driven off looters…and worse. One of Zog's patrols stopped by soon after the flood. I fought them off, but some escaped. I am sure they will be back in greater numbers.;;Thanys;;
614;I have no more rations to give. If you need more, you'll have to find food elsewhere.;;Masul NPC 68;;
615;What with the damage caused by giant waves, falling rocks and the pirate raid, I don't know if our village will ever be the same. I know you have done great things for us, but not everything can be fixed once broken. I'm not sure what we'll do. Perhaps we will rebuild, or maybe we'll leave. Time and circumstance will decide.;;Brekish Onefang NPC 1;;
616;Good work dealing with those pirates. Now that they're gone, maybe Chief Onefang and his people can rebuild their lives. It really is a travesty what has happened here.;;Dadeross;;
617;Sadly, the caravan was one of the first things the pirates looted in their raids. I have no idea what they're going to do with three-hundred cases of tobersk fruit! Naturally, I miss the fruit, but the worst of it is the damage they did to the carts. It looks like I'll be here for at least the next season overseeing their repair. I just hope the task is done before the next tobersk harvest so I can see some return out of this profitless venture.;;Dadeross;;
618;You are indeed earning your way to this months bounty but have not yet reached the number of kills needed!;;Bounty Hunter;;
619;Yellow Fever is a very crippling disease that pops up every few years.  Usually we arrange for medicine from the mainland, but now that the bridges are destroyed, no one can make it to the docks!;;James;;
620;Here, take these scrolls of Cure Disease.  Maybe we can at least prevent an epidemic!  The six huts on the outer islands are infected.  If the teleporters between the islands are repaired, you can take these scrolls to the huts.  Unfortunately you will have to find three more scrolls in your travels.;;James;;
621;The Yellow Fever epidemic is over!  Thank you for your help!;;James;;
622;I hear that Yellow Fever is once again spreading through the people.  Usually the water supply here on the main island is the primary source of the disease.  We used to get an Anointed Herb Potion from the mainland when the disease popped up.  Without access to the dock however, we cannot get this needed cure.  If you find a way to the mainland, perhaps the smugglers of Ravenshore have the cure.  If you can procure the Anointed Potion, return to me with it!;;James;;
623;Thank you!  I will go introduce this to the water supply!;;James;;
624;Perhaps you can bring me the basic ingredients for a Potion of Pure speed?  With them I can make this incredible potion and finish my studies in alchemy!  I will reward you well for your assistance!;;James;;

627;I believe I may know how to stop the destructive force of the mountain of fire!  I have found an ancient spell that should give me the power to send the mountain of fire back into the sea! To complete the spell I need an ancient relic called the Idol of the Snake.  With this item of power I should be able to complete the spell.;;James;;
628;Thank you for returning with the Idol.  Upon further study I discovered that the entire spell was useless.  Still, this is not your fault and you deserve some reward for returning to me!;;James;;
629;"The packs of Dire Wolves that roam this region are a threat to travelers and commerce.

638;Many decades ago, the legendary Priest of the Sun, Camien Thryce, led a crusade against the Necromancers' Guild in Shadowspire.  The Guild was able to defeat Thryce's forces with the aid of the Vampires that also dwell in the Shadowspire region.  Camien Thryce carried with him the clerical artifact called Eclipse with him into battle.  The shield was lost when Thryce was struck down by a Nosferatu in the final battle.;;James;;

672;In times almost forgotten a powerful Necromancer named Zacharia almost dominated all of Jadame.  His mastery of the dark arts of necromancy and the elemental magics were combined with an unnaturally strong afinity for Dark energy. His legions of undead helped him enslave all peoples, including the Dark Elves of Alvar.  A plan was made by the Temple of the Sun to defeat Zacharia.  Utilizing the combined might of all of the Clerics in the Temple they forged the sword named Solkrist.  The Patriarch of the Temple led the legions of the Sun against the forces of Zacharia.  The battle raged for years after which the forces of the Temple of the Sun found themselves at the base of the dreaded Shadowspire.  There the Patriarch battled Zarcharia in single combat. At the end of the battle both the Patriarch and Zacharia lay dead.  The Patriarch had cut the left arm from Zacharia's body just as the Necromancer's last spell stopped the Patriarch's heart.  The power of the sword Solkrist instantly slew the Necromancer.  Solkrist disappeared forever in the mayhem after the fight, as did the arm of Zacharia.  The bone from this arm was so instilled with such Dark Magic that it was called the Bone of Doom.;;James;;
673;Ah, the Bone of Doom!  The legend of Zacharia will continue!  Here is your reward!;;James;;

782;Lying as they do on opposite ends of the Light to Dark spectrum, relationships between the Necromancers' Guild and the Temple of the Sun have never been the best, but now they battle openly. Oskar Tyre, head priest of the Temple says a holy vision drove him to declare war on the guild so as to rid Jadame of the taint of darkness.;;;;
;;;;;
"Both groups are relative newcomers to our continent. The guild has set up its foothold in Shadowspire, and the First (and only) Sun Temple of Jadame is in Murmurwoods.""";;Sahil Ittalle;;;
783;Through your delivery of the Nightshade Brazier into their hands, the Necromancers' Guild has come out on top in their war with the Temple of the Sun. The artifact's magic creates a permanent shadow of darkness which surrounds the Shadowspire region. Under this cover, vampires defend the land both day and night. This has allowed the guild to field larger forces of skeletons, zombies and other undead against the temple's armies. Each report I receive puts the heart of the battle closer and closer to the Sun Temple's doorstep.;;Sahil Ittalle;;
784;Because you have destroyed the Necromancers' Guild Skeleton Transformer, the Temple of the Sun has come out on top in their war with the guild. The skeletons created by the device made up the bulk of the guild's reinforcements. Without these, the necromancers' forces crumble before the temple's advance. Each report I receive puts the heart of the battle closer to the Necromancers' Guild doorstep.;;Sahil Ittalle;;
785;"The renown Dragon slayer, Charles Quixote of Erathia, has set up a hunting expedition in Garrote Gorge. This is no ""safari,"" in fact, it's the largest operation of this type I've heard of. The hunters have a permanent base from which they sell hides, eggs, baby dragons, and other items. Garrote Gorge has always had a large Dragon population, but I imagine they must be facing extinction--so efficient are Quixote's hunters.";;Sahil Ittalle;;
786;It seems Charles Quixote's Dragon hunting operation in Garrote Gorge has almost completely wiped out Garrote Gorge's Dragon population. I'm sure once their done, those mountains will be safer to travel. Still, I wonder what Jadame will be like without Dragons.;;Sahil Ittalle;;
787;By recovering Deftclaw Redreaver's heir for him, you've allowed him to safely attack Charles Quixote's camp. Dragon hunters operate by isolating members of their prey. They just aren't prepared to face Dragons in number! Needless to say, the camp's production of Dragon goods has dwindled to a trickle. A pity. The guild used to turned a good profit off them.;;Sahil Ittalle;;
788;The Minotaurs of Balthazar Lair in Ravage Roaming are a proud culture. Their recent defeat of the Vori Frost Giants has, if anything, made them even more fiercely independent--more sure of their ability to face any task alone. Still, I have told the guild that they would make great allies, both to face the current crisis and later as trade partners.;;Sahil Ittalle;;
789;By rescuing the Balthazar Lair Minotaurs, you have ingratiated them to yourselves and by extension, to our guild. Even through the crisis, trade relations with them have improved immeasurably. Once maters of the cataclysm are resolved, I'm sure we will see a tidy profit--a direct result from your good work.;;Sahil Ittalle;;
790;Who knows the fate of Jadame now.  Perhaps you will find a way to save us from destruction?;;James;;
791;Jadame owes you a great debt!  You have saved the entire world from total destruction!;;James;;
792;With the bridges destroyed by the eruption of the mountain of fire, we cannot get to the boat dock!  We are cut off from the mainland!;;James;;
793;You have repaired the Portals of Stone?  We are all in your debt.  If only it was safe to travel through the Abandoned Temple!  Well, at least we can attempt to get to the boat dock through there.;;James;;
794;We used to have a nice series of bridges between the small islands of this region and one large bridge to the main land.  The volcano destroyed all of these.  Now we cannot travel anywhere except by boat, but we cannot even get to our boat dock!;;;;
795;Did you know I was their captive for over six years? At first, I thought they were devils from hell, but now I am not so sure. They looked like devils surely, but did not act as demons. No, I think they were but another type of monstrous race, like ogres or goblins. Regardless, devils or not, I am glad the world is rid of them!;;Roland Ironfist;;
796;"Catherine and I have had dealings with these ""lords"" of the elemental planes. I've never trusted them, and now it seems I am right. They were our recent allies against the Kreegans, but a few months later, we find ourselves at war with them here! In both cases I understand neither their reasons for helping or hindrance. They are fickle beings at best...""treacherous"" is perhaps a better word for them.";;Roland Ironfist;;
797;I must say I'm looking forward to returning to my lands of Enroth. It has been so long since I've seen them, or my son, Prince Nicolai. He was just a lad when I saw him last and now he is nearly grown. Sir Humphrey was a good choice for regent, but the land has been too long without its king at the reins of state.;;Roland Ironfist;;
798;After we defeated the Kreegans in Erathia, I abdicated my throne into the regenthood of one of my generals, Morgan Kendal. I have left in his capable hands the task of choosing Erathia's new ruler. I'm sure this seems to be much to give up, but I am first and foremost, the queen of Enroth. We were sailing for there when the cataclysm struck, drawing us here.;;Catherine Ironfist;;
799;"The Kreegans? They are no more; I am sure of it. After we put down Lucifer Kreegan, my armies scoured Eofol searching for any signs of their continued existence. We found none. No, the Kreegan infestation of our world is eliminated.";;Catherine Ironfist;;
800;I fought alongside elementals in our campaigns against the Kreegan. I found them stalwart and loyal. I know Roland disagrees, but I cannot call their hostility here a case of fickleness. No, I think something else drives them to attack us--magic perhaps? You should speak with our sage, Xanthor. He has been studying the Destroyer's crystal. I'm sure he's come up with some theory by now.;;Catherine Ironfist;;
801;We used to travel freely between the islands using the bridges.  These bridges were destroyed when the mountain of fire erupted.  Many families are trapped on the outer islands.  We don’t even know if the people who live there are still alive.;;James;;
802;With the Portals of Stone repaired, we can at least check on the outer islands and those who live there.  We are in your debt for fixing the Portals of Stone.;;James;;
803;The boat dock on the northernmost island is the only way to travel between Dagger Wound and the mainland.  With the bridges destroyed, we cannot get to the boat dock and those arriving from Ravenshore cannot get to the village of Blood Drop!;;James;;

810;I have traveled to these lands to catalog its array of available cheese. My task is nearly complete, but there are yet three cheeses I have yet to sample. These are Frelandeau, Eldenbrie and Dunduck. I would reward highly any who could locate these rare and reputedly tasty culinary gems for me.;;Asael Fromago;;
811;You say you will find me the cheeses I desire, but here you are returned, empty-handed! Do not waste my precious time! Bring me cheese--Frelandeau, Eldenbrie and Dunduck! Do not return until you have them!;;Asael Fromago;;
812;Very good, you have found me some of the cheese I seek. But now I have my heart set on a full cheese tasting with all three cheeses eaten at once so I can savor them in comparison. Come back when you have then all. I will not take what you have now. I don't think I could resist sampling what you leave--and then the cheese tasting would be ruined!;;Asael Fromago;;
813;Excellent! Give me the cheeses! I must consume them!;;;;
;;;;;
Ah….munch munch….frelandeau, exquisite….mmmm, and eldenbrie, wondrously smoky…and hmmm, dunduck…well, that's not very nice, is it?;;;;;

"You have made my Jadamean cheese cataloging safari a success! I can die a happy man! You have the humble thanks of a man of cheese. And here is your promised reward!""";;Asael Fromago;;;
814;"There are no people more dedicated to cheesecraft than the august cheese masters of Vori. Otherwise known to be rather barbaric, the Vori Frost Giants are true emblems of the potential of civilized development--at least as far as cheese making is concerned. Did you know that they have forty-two different words for ""cheese.""";;Asael Fromago;;
815;Even as a lad I knew I had a special relationship with cheese. Why, my first memory is of nibbling a bit of farmer's cheddar from my mother's hand! From that day I knew it would be my passion to eat cheese, to know all of the endless variety of its tasty wonderment, and to search the world for rare and exotic cheese-stuff. And so have I made my life...and destiny.;;Asael Fromago;;
816;With the cheeses you have brought me, I have now eaten all of the world's known cheeses. Now none can say that I, Asael Fromago, am not history's most eminent connoisseur of cheese! None can compare to my glory! Ha-ha-ha…;;Asael Fromago;;
817;The night the stranger came through here was the same night that the crystal erupted in the center of town.  I only caught a glimpse of the stranger.  He didn’t appear the potent mage that he was.  I was not in the town square when he summoned the crystal, but I did see the flash of light that traveled across the sky.  It was truly a terrible night.;;Hint Ravenshore;;
818;A wanderer came into town.  Several ruffians sought to relieve this traveler of whatever wealth he possibly possessed. The wanderer barely paid any of them much notice.  With a small flick of his wrist all fell before him.  Then he walked to the town square and summoned the giant crystal that you'll find there today.;;Hint Ravenshore;;
819;"There is an ancient saying among the Dark Elf people,  ""a thing lives only as long as the last person who remembers it.""  The events the night the crystal burst forth into our lives will live for a very long time.  Many of us saw the events of that night.  The mage who summoned forth the crystal said not one word to anyone us.  When he looked upon us, it seemed that all there was in his heart and eyes was pity.";;Hint Ravenshore;;
820;When the mage came into town I didn’t think much of it.  This is Ravenshore.  Everyone who travels the roads of Jadame comes through here at some time or another.  I guess I should have paid more attention to him.  Seems he caused quite a stir in the town square.;;Hint Ravenshore;;
821;The Pirates of Regna own the seas.  No one can stand against them!  Several years ago, some fishing boat captains thought that they could sail to Erathia to get help dealing with the pirates.  We never saw or heard from them again.;;Hint Ravenshore, Dagger Wound, Ravage Roaming, Shadowspire;;
822;The Regnans are the worst slime to ever set foot on the shore of Jadame. They keep the peoples of this continent from trading with Erathia and Enroth.  What choice do we have?  Even the Merchants of Alvar couldn’t muster a fleet to deal with the pirates.  Rumor says that there are smugglers around that have found ways around the pirate blockades.;;Hint Ravenshore, Dagger Wound, Ravage Roaming, Shadowspire;;
823;The Regnans call themselves the Empire of the Endless Ocean--trying to make more of themselves than there really is.  All they are is bullies and bandits.  Of course, don’t tell them that I said that!;;Hint Ravenshore, Dagger Wound, Ravage Roaming, Shadowspire;;
824;Over the last few weeks there have been reports of bandits and Ogres robbing travelers on all of the major roads of Jadame. Times just seem to be getting worse.  Between the Regnan Pirates and these bandits it seems that no one is safe to travel by any means.;;Hint Alvar;;
825;Several of the warriors got together to go take care of the ogres that were camping on the road to Ravenshore.  That’s when we first had word of the fortress they were constructing to the southwest of here.  Since the fortress was completed the roads to the south and west have not been safe.;;Hint Alvar;;
826;The Smuggler of Jadame may be a myth, but I think not.  The Merchants of Alvar seem to be able to send small amounts of goods away across the sea to Erathia and Enroth.  Yet they own no boats of their own.   This would seem to support the idea that there really are smugglers.  Now why they work for the merchants is beyond the likes of me.;;Hint Ravenshore, Alvar;;
827;Wererats!  They are the worst of scum!  The pick through our trash at night!  Always scurrying around in the dark!  Never seen when the sun is up.  Gives one the shivers it does!;;Hint Ravenshore, Alvar;;
828;The Cyclopes that dwell to the southeast of here have always been a threat to the village of Rust!  But the village has always been able to push back any raid.  They aren't so tough in small numbers, but if they can catch you out in the desert unaware, you will not survive!  ;;Hint Ironsand;;
829;The sea of fire took us all by surprise.  It spread through the eastern half of the village like wildfire.  Luckily its growth seems to have slowed.  Still I don’t know how much longer any of us can last.;;Hint Ironsand;;
830;We need to find a new place to live!  There is no way any people could live under these conditions.  Even the Cyclopes will be forced to move.  There are legends that talk about the ancient homeland that we traveled here from.  The stories say that it was lush and green.  If we only had such a place to return to.;;Hint Ironsand;;
831;There are traders in Alvar and Shadowspire that trade for the different types of ore that can be found all over Jadame.  They use the ore to create items that they are more than happy to trade for more ore!;;Hint anywhere;;
832;"You know, it is said the Vault of Time was here before Ravenshore; the town was built around it. It is supposed to contain the treasure of the old Emperor Thorn who ruled the lands around here hundreds of years ago. Many come here to try and open the vault, but none succeed.";;Poundlin Deerhunter;;
833;As if Quixote was not enough of a problem to plague us, we must also contend with Ilsingore, Ilsingore and Old Loeb--renegades among our kind! They think they can rebuild our race by scattering across Jadame and starting their own tribes. Fools! All they do is weaken us by removing themselves from our numbers. Yaardrake has fled to the Ironsand Desert. I know not where the others have gone.;;Bazalath NPC 443;;
834;While Garrote Gorge has the highest concentration of dragons in Jadame, I hear there is hunting to be had elsewhere. For instance, there is rumored to be a great old dragon out in the Ironsand Desert. Another is supposed to be somewhere in the badlands of Ravage Roaming.;;Isram Delver NPC 418;;
835;When Charles Quixote brought us over from Erathia, we sailed past Regna Island. Since this was our first sight of Jadamean land on the voyage, it was an omen of our hunting expedition's future success that I saw an ancient dragon winging its way towards the island. How I wish I could get a spear in that one! It was the biggest dragon I'd ever seen!;;topic 675;;
836;Yes, I was here the day the Destroyer walked through Ravenshore! I was at the blacksmith's getting a knife sharpened. He walked right past us like he owned the town. A crowd was following him at a distance. One of them threw a rock, but it bounced off a magic shield surrounding him. He didn't even seem to notice. Later I heard an explosion from the town square. I ran out to look, but the Destroyer was gone and that crystal and scattered bodies were all that remained.;;Elsie Apple NPC 405;;
837;"Yeah, I saw the ""Destroyer"" and well named he is! I thought he was a rich merchant, and he looked like easy prey, so I…well, I tried to rob him. I ran ahead of him and lay in ambush in an alley, waiting for him to pass. When he walked by, I made a grab for him. My mistake! I didn't even touch him! As soon as I got near him, I was thrown back by his magic. In fact, I was thrown over a house into the next street!";;Aznog Black NPC 409;;
838;"Those cursed ratmen--those so-called ""Priests of Eep""--are nothing but trouble. More like a pack of thieves than holy men, they are! I'll warn you, traveler. Keep an eye on your equipment when they're around. They'll steal anything that isn't nailed down.";;Mortie Bith NPC 408;;
839;Well, if you're looking for cheese, I daresay you will find it in the churches of Eep. You know mice like cheese. Well, this rule also applies to the ratmen of Eep. It is said that they keep a horde of the stuff in each of their temples.;;Jillian Applebee NPC 406;;
840;On top of all of our problems here, the lord of our plane, Gralkor the Cruel is missing. He is a being of great power and could no doubt fight the dark magic which assails this plane.;;Plane of Earth one;;
841;I wish I understood what has happened here. One day it was life as usual here…and this is normally a peaceful realm. Then suddenly everyone was howling with violent madness and was filled with a thirst to crush your land of Jadame. Even now my fellow Earth Plane denizens work single-mindedly to push the firmament of our realm into yours.;;Plane of Earth two;;
842;Perhaps the reason I am not affected by the madness is that I carry with me an amulet given to me by the lord of this plane, Shalwend. It is said in our legends that he and the other elemental lords made your world. No doubt if Shalwend was here he could stop the creeping madness, but he is missing! Where is our lord in our time of greatest need?;;Plane of Air one;;
843;It was clearly magic which caused the madness that has taken my fellow Plane of Air dwellers. On the day it struck there was instant chaos. All who were affected dropped what they were doing and began to howl. It was a chorus of horror! Only a handful of us maintain our sanity. Now, day by day, our glorious realm falls further and further towards a state of hellish decline.;;Plane of Air two;;
844;I am not unschooled in the ways of magic. Clearly some spell of almost unimaginable power has affected those that live in this watery realm. My main curiosity is to know why this has occurred. Clearly no one would risk using such power if it was not to achieve some terrible end. All I know is that the Plane of Water makes war upon your realm. From here, I can discern no reason to it!;;Plane of Water one;;
845;W-what has h-happened to my home w-waters? All are c-consumed by m-m-madness! And worse, our l-lord is m-missing! Where is our r-ruler, th-the mighty Acw-w-walander! W-without him w-we are d-doomed!;;Plane of Water two;;
846;I know to your eyes, this plane must seem a hell-scape. But I tell you, normally it is not so. Before the madness we lived here together in a state of peace and harmony. But then, one day the madness fell and our Lord Pyrannaste was nowhere to be found. Perhaps his absence caused the madness? It may be so, he has never before been gone from this realm in my memory.;;Plane of Fire one;;
847;Though the madness affects almost all of those that live here, it has not robbed them of their cunning. As I am sure you are aware, they make war on your realm, but it is not with crazed abandon that they do so. Leaders have emerged among the affected, and these make shrewd military designs against you. Even now they mass near the gateway to Jadame in preparation for a massive assault.;;Plane of Fire two;;
848;The Snapfinger family tomb is one of the lowest in our village's burial catacombs. Since we are such an honored family, our crypt is the largest. It isn't the easiest place to find--even I have become lost looking for it! When I do, I find it by keeping a hand on the right-side wall. I eventually get there.;;Overdune Snapfinger NPC 7;;

856;No…no, that life is over for me. Besides, if I were to take up the mace again, it would be with other companions. I'm afraid--if I may speak bluntly--I just can't see myself traveling with a group as inexperienced as yours.;;Maylander;;
857;Say, that sounds grand! Yes, I will go with you, if you will have me.;;Maylander;;
858;"I think not! Why would I travel with the likes of you? Perhaps you didn't catch my name, ""Jasp Thelbourne?"" Yes, that ""Thelbourne,"" rabble. No, whatever you're up to, I'm not interested.";;Thelbourne;;
859;Yes, we'd make quite a team! We have all done such great deeds, how could not further greatness follow from our joining together? I'll go with you if you want.;;Thelbourne;;
860;Now that I need not fear my heir's destruction. I will visit my revenge on Quixote. His camp will face the assault of fire and claw. Those who have hunted us are now our prey animals.;;;;
;;;;;
"As for your alliance…you have done me a great service. I will honor my debt. As soon as I've set my enemies to flight or the beyond, I will join the alliance council in Ravenshore.""";;Deftclaw Redreaver;;;
861;I tell you, with all that's going on, it's like an honest merchant can't get business done! I mean, we've always had to deal with Ogre raiders, but now they've grown so bold as to have built a fort right here in Alvar! Now no caravans can take the west road to Murmurwoods. The worst of it is most of my trade with the Temple of the Sun there!;;D Farswell;;
862;You have done us all a great service by clearing out the Ogre's fort. Now our caravans can freely travel to Murmurwoods. I thank you…and my purse certainly thanks you!;;D Farswell;;
863;Sure we have wasps in Alvar--and rather large ones, too--but we tolerate them for good reason. Many of our customers desire wasp products. Say…if you want to get in on the action, the trader, Veldon, is a broker for wasp parts. He lives here in town, and I hear he is currently trying to fill a large order for wasp stingers.;;B Featherwind NPC422;;
864;Not many people know this, but it is possible to train a Dragon. It's sort of like breaking a horse, except that it requires more special equipment and a lot of magic. Those tame Dragons outside the fort are an example of my work. Right now they are loyal to us, but I will bond them to their ultimate customer, Fennis Greenwood, a minor lord back in Erathia. Well, I will do so as soon as he pays us, that is.;;Weldrick Falconeye NPC 420;;
865;Zanthora is a strange character. Not to say that members of the Necromancers' Guild are not all strange, but she is truly mad. I hear that other guild members simply refuse to work with her--so terrible are her experiments. Still, they value her dark genius. To keep her around, they built her a lab of her own out on the marshy wastes outside of town.;;K Fellburn NPC 423;;
866;"For the most part, the Necromancers' Guild has the local vampires under control…mostly. But there's one place you don't want to go! Most of them sleep in a communal crypt north of the guild. Watch out if you go there. They're a bit, shall we say…""territorial.""";;L Gallowswell NPC 428;;
867;The Necromancers' Guild? Hey, I think they're great. You should have seen this place before they came--nothing going on at all! Sure, we got vampires, skeletons and other undead running around. Still, I gotta say, things are sure a lot more lively around here!;;A Fiddlebone NPC 424;;
868;As you might imagine, business is great. Oh, sure, the guild necromancers turn most of my customers into skeletons and zombies, but vampires are repeat business! Want a piece of the action? There's a wood dealer in town, Mylander, who is always looking for good Murmurwood lumber. If you have any he'll pay a pretty penny for it.;;Sethrik Fist NPC 425;;
869;Hunting has become pretty hazardous of late, but still we must do it if we are to eat! Yesterday I was out along the western shore of the fire lake and found a tunnel that seems to go under the lake. I didn't explore it though. It was infested with gogs and worse...like everything else around here these days.;;Bigfist Slowstepper NPC 426;;
870;Even we who live here get lost. If you would not lose your way, follow the floating waystones. Ahhh…the madness returns….It returns!;;Zephyr NPC 427;;
871;Ah, I'm glad you're out saving the world. I mean, someone has to do it. Me, I'm for the easy life. As long as I got my boat and my pole, and the fish are biting, I don't see any reason to do much else. Good luck to you though!;;Davee Sail NPC 503;;
872;That Stanley, now there's a Regnan with some spark! Why I hear he's the one that got us in good with that thar Zog the Jackal--some sort of Ogre or giant Troll or something, I think--a genuine barbarian king. Now we got us our ships on the seas and a bunch of club swinging devils on the land. I tell ya, the Great and Mighty Regnan Empire is headed for greatness, what with the likes of the Dread Pirate Stanley doing for us!;;Erik Jarblower NPC 504;;
873;Oh sure, we Regnans have to put up with a bit of competition--I'm talking about smugglers, you know--but I understand the Dread Pirate Stanley is putting the clamp on that. Why I understand he kidnapped Arion Hunter's family just so he can pressure the wererat into staying off our turf. ;;Jarrena Marmon NPC 505;;
874;"Yeah, I know the ""Dread"" Pirate Stanley is the hero of the moment around here, but I say, fah! Sure he's done a lot for Regna, but no man does anything that doesn't help himself. Why I hear old Stanley's been shaving off the top of every deal he's in--and that's a lot of deals! What I'd like to know is where he keeps his booty. Probably not on Regna, I reckon. It wouldn't be a fortnight before someone dug it up!";;Pirate Paul NPC 506;;
875;I have come up with a scheme for finding hidden treasure. Before you barged in, I was hard at work formulating a spell for sensing gold hidden beneath the ground. If I am successful, I plan to have a Dragon carry me over the wastelands of Ravage Roaming where the Dread Pirate Stanley's treasure is rumored to be buried. My spell will find it and I will be a wealthy man.;;Yoel Wargreen NPC 507;;
876;You mean the one just north of here? Well, none of us have anything to do with it. It's haunted!;;Pordo NPC 508;;
877;I don't know where they're at, but I know there's some of them ratmen around here somewhere. At night I hear all sorts of squeaking and scuffling outside. In the morning, pretty much everything that isn't under lock or bolted down is gone. If I knew where that Eep church was. I'd take some of my boys over for a little...talk.;;Vish NPC 509;;
878;I was out with one of the crews working along the new lake searching for things that were washed out of the lair. We think we found the source of the flood. There is a strange gateway out in the middle of the lake. We don't have any boats, so we didn't explore it, but even from the shore, it is clear to see that it leads to a watery realm.;;Ferris NPC 510;;
879;Well, if you haven't been to the fortress, that's the first place you should go. As you are aware from your orientation, the so-called fortress on this island is just a front to fool our enemies. You'll need to make your way to the real fort on the crescent island. Just take the underground passage marked on your orientation map.;;ex-captain terrence NPC 511;;
880;"I know they call us ""pirates"" on Jadame, but really, we're just running our empire. It is not our fault that our Jadamean subjects refuse to acknowledge our rule and do not pay their taxes. Since they do not pay, we're forced to collect tribute in the form of booty. Actually we prefer it this way--saves us the trouble of having to actually rule the continent.";;F Ferne NPC 512;;
881;We vampires cannot normally walk about in the daylight, but Thant the Necromancers' Guildmaster has created an artifact to deal with this. A vampire wearing one of his Nightshade Amulets can move about freely day or night. Sadly, there are few available. I myself do not have one so must stay indoors during the day.;;Dierdre Wallace NPC 513;;
882;Normally, we vampires need one of Thant's Nightshade Amulets to travel freely during the day, but since you've brought us the Nightshade Brazier, glorious night covers Shadowspire around the clock! Now those of us who don't have the amulets can walk about during the day...well, at least as long as we stay in the area.;;Dierdre Wallace NPC 513;;
883;Though it isn't my style, I must say a lot of folks around here like to cover themselves with all sorts of jewelry. They say it's fashion, but I just find it gaudy. Anyway, if you have any to sell go find Pavel in town. He does a brisk trade in all sorts of tacky junk.;;Nalani NPC 514;;
884;You looking for sunfish? Sorry, can't help you. Funny thing is, I had a whole catch of them just last week, but Pavel the merchant bought the whole lot. Maybe you can get them from him.;;R Mercer NPC 515;;
885;Centuries ago the largest battle to date between the Guild of Necromancers and the Temple of the Sun was fought on this spot!  So much magical energy was released that the very ground was scorched and is black to this very day!;;James Hint;;
886;"Very good…or at least, as good as can be expected. You managed to bring three partners into the alliance--the minimum number my advisors told me would be sufficient to fulfill the ""…Jadame, must stand together…"" part of the prophecy. A pity it could not be more, but events of the cataclysm are clearly coming to a head. It is time to move onward.";;;;
;;;;;
"You must travel to Ravenshore and meet with the alliance council gathered there. With them, decide what must be the next step we take in meeting the elemental crisis.""";;Bastian Loudrin;;;
887;We have a small warehouse downstairs. You are free to use the chests there to store extra equipment. Put anything in there you don't want to wander off!;;Elgar Fellmoon;;
888;Thank you for releasing me. Know that Shalwend, Lord of Air, holds you in his favor. ;;;;
;;;;;
"I go now to restore order to my realm and to join with my fellow lords to do what I can for yours. Be warned! Our actions will destabilize the crystal gateway. Leave now for your home, lest you be trapped here forever.  Inform Xanthor of what has happened here. Farewell""";;Shalwend;;;
889;"""The Destroyer"" is a fitting moniker for one who would imprison me in such a fashion. If it were not for you, I, Acwalander, Lord of Water, would have soon perished. My passing would have had an unbalancing effect across all the planes. Thank you. I go now to gather with the other lords. Together we will set things right.";;;;
;;;;;
" Be warned! Our actions will destabilize the crystal gateway. Leave now for your home, lest you be trapped here forever. Inform Xanthor of what has happened here. Farewell.""";;Acwalander;;;
890;"I am free! Now will he who was fool enough to jail me--this Destroyer--feel my wrath. That I, the Lord of Earth, am called ""Gralkor the Cruel"" is no mistake. The suffering I have felt will be his returned in multitudes!";;;;
;;;;;
"I go now to gather with the other lords. Together we will set things right. Be warned! Our actions will destabilize the crystal gateway. Leave now for your home, lest you be trapped here forever. Inform Xanthor of what has happened here. Farewell""";;Gralkor;;;
891;Free at last. My torment is over, but what of my subjects? I know the Destroyer has them compelled to a terrible task. My presence will sooth them. I must go to restore order to my realm and yours.;;;;
;;;;;
"Before I return to the Plane of Fire, I will gather with the other lords. Together we will set things right. Be warned! Our actions will destabilize the crystal gateway. Leave now for your home, lest you be trapped here forever.  Inform Xanthor of what has happened here. Farewell""";;Pyrannaste;;;
892;Oh, what a mess you've made of things! When I asked you to find me a witness of events in the Ironsand Desert, I thought it would be obvious that you'd have to return him to me in good condition! I mean look at the poor Troll! Take him to the temple and get him fixed up.;;;;
;;;;;
"And please...try to remember you're working for the guild. We do have a reputation for conducting ourselves with at least passing competence.""";;Bastian Loudrin;;;
893;You found Ebonest?  What of my father?  Where is he?  I thought you were going to return when you had found both my father and the spear.;;Leane;;
894;You found my father and Ebonest?  I will be forever in your debt!  We should take the spear to Charles Quixote, and if he is agreeable, he will promote me and any knights in your party!;;Leane;;
895;You are employed by the Merchants of Alvar, yes? Well, I think you should speak with Dadeross, the leader of your caravan. My far seeing vision tells me he is on the Dagger Wound Islands.;;seer;;
896;Hmmm…I cannot look too far ahead--for the ether is thick today. All I see is that you must deliver the letter Dadeross gave you to the merchant, Elgar Fellmoon. Fellmoon lives in the city of Ravenshore.;;seer;;
897;I see a vision of you in which you take a letter from Elgar Fellmoon in Ravenshore to Arion Hunter, the leader of the Ravenshore smugglers. After this, you return to Fellmoon. The end of the vision is a blur, so you must not have lived entirely through it. Still, it is your fate to do these things.;;seer;;
898;I don't need my vision to tell me what you must do next. Do as Fellmoon asked of you. Go seek Bastian Loudrin, the guildmaster of the Alvarian Merchant Guild. He is in the city of Alvar.;;seer;;
899;I see an important connection has not been made between the present and your future. You must return to Bastian Loudrin and continue your conversations with him. He will send you on the next step down your road.;;seer;;
900;In my dreams last night, I saw you traveling to the Ironsand Desert to find a witness to the formation of a great lake of fire which formed there during the cataclysm.;;seer;;
901;It is clear to me that you must bring the Troll, Overdune, to the merchant guild in Alvar.;;seer;;
902;I see far through space today, but not through time. A great disaster has befallen the Minotaurs of Balthazar Lair in Ravage Roaming. I feel that your destiny is linked with their fate. You must rescue them from their peril.;;seer;;
903;There is great turmoil in the Balance. It has taken me some time to know its source, but I know it now. It is caused by the war between the clerics of the Temple of the Sun located in Murmurwoods, and the Necromancers' Guild of Shadowspire. It is your destiny to undo the turmoil by choosing one of these two to ally with.;;seer;;
904;There is great turmoil in the Balance. It has taken me some time to know its source, but I know it now. There is conflict between the Dragons and Knights who fight in Garrote Gorge. It is your destiny to ally with one of the two at the expense of the other.;;seer;;
905;You have done good work in forging the alliances you have. It is now time for you to seek the council of those allies you have brought together. Seek them out in their council chamber within the merchant guild in Ravenshore.;;seer;;
906;I see an important connection has not been made between the present and your future destiny. You must return to the council chamber in the Ravenshore merchant guild. The councilors will send you on the next step down your road.;;seer;;
907;You must do as the alliance council has asked of you. Find a way to Regna Island and sink the Regnan port fleet.;;seer;;
908;In case you haven't heard, Ravenshore is under attack by the Regnan pirates. The town has been evacuated. You must eliminate the pirate threat before the alliance council will return to guide you.;;seer;;
909;Now that you've sunk the Regnan fleet. Go and seek the wisdom of your alliance council. They will give you the next task that will make your destiny.;;seer;;
910;You must speak to the Ironfists' court sage, Xanthor. He is housed in Ravenshore.;;seer;;
911;I see an important link between the present and your future has not been forged. Seek out the sage, Xanthor who resides in Ravenshore. He will send you on your destiny's next task.;;seer;;
912;It is clear that you must do as Xanthor has asked of you. Go to the four elemental planes and find in each, an elemental heartstone.;;seer;;
913;Now that you have the four elemental heartstones, you must now bring them to Xanthor in Ravenshore.;;seer;;
914;Your destiny lies through the crystal gateway in Ravenshore. It will take you to the Plane Between Planes. There you will find the source of the elemental cataclysm.;;seer;;
915;You have talked to the Destroyer, but have failed to gather from him the key which will unlock your future. Return to him and continue your conversations.;;seer;;
916;Your path is clear to my vision. You must seek out the four elemental lords and release them from their prisons. These prisons are in the Destroyer's realm--the Plane Between Planes.;;seer;;
917;Seek out Xanthor! Though he is but a piece in the game of Balance, the next move you make towards destiny it through a meeting with him.;;seer;;
918;The Balance is restored. Now that your destiny is made, I can no longer guide you--my sight only pertains to what is connected to the fate of Balance. What you do now is up to you. Good luck to you, Heroes of Jadame!;;seer;;
919;You cannot be promoted until we know where Cauri Blackthorne is!  Locate her, and she will promote you.  After she is found and has retuned to the Merchant Guild, I will be glad to promote any Dark Elves in your party to Patriarch.;;Jeebes;;
920;Cauri told me of how you helped her with the curse of the Basilisk.  She has instructed me to promote any Dark Elves that travel with you to Patriarch.;;Jeebes;;
921;You cannot be promoted until the Ancient Troll Home has been found!  Return here when you have found it and talk with Volog.;;;;
922;Before Volog left, he instructed me to promote any Trolls that travel with you to War Troll.  The village of Rust will be forever thankful to you!;;;;
923;You cannot be promoted to Champion until you have proven yourself worthy!  ;;;;
924;Thanks for you help recovering the spear Ebonest!  I can promote any Knights that travel with you to Champion.;;;;
925;You have not proven yourself worthy!  Until you strike a blow against the Dragon Hunters, none of you will be promoted!;;;;
926;You have proven yourself and I will promote any Dragons that travel with you to Great Wyrm.;;;;
927;You cannot be promoted to Priest of the Sun until you have recovered the Prophecies of the Sun!;;;;
928;You are always welcome here!  Of course I will promote any Clerics that travel with you to Priest of the Sun!  ;;;;
929;You have not recovered the Lost Book of Kehl!  There will be no promotions until you return with the book!  Speak with Vetrinus Taleshire.;;;;
930;Ah, you return seeking promotion for others in your party?  I have not forgotten your help in recovering the Lost Book of Kehl!  All Necromancers in your party will be promoted to Lich.  Be sure each Necromancer has a Lich Jar in his possession.;;;;
931;You have not found Korbu and until you have I refuse to promote any of you!  Begone!;;;;
932;Any Vampires among you will be promoted to Nosferatu!  I remember those who helped in the recovery of the Remains of Korbu.;;;;
933;You have not found the Axe of Balthazar!  You are not worthy of promotion!;;;;
934;The Herd of Masul is in debt to you.  Any Minotaurs in your party are promoted to Minotaur Lord!;;;;
935;My father sent you to rescue me?  I am grateful.  I will return to my father and let him know of your assistance!;;;;
936;Where is the Vial of Grave Dirt?  Do not bother me until you have it!;;;;
937;I cannot yet travel with you!  I would sooner sign on with a merchant caravan, than travel with you.  Return to me when you have discovered more of the world, and your place in it.;;;;
938;I remember you!  The Book of Kehl has proven invaluable, and it would be a privilege to travel with you.;;;;
939;When you have grown and learned more of the ways of the world, then it would be my pleasure to travel with you.  Until then I have studies to complete here.;;;;
940;Certainly!  Traveling with you would be an honor!;;;;
941;You have done us a great service, adventurers. On behalf of my herd, I give you our humblest thanks. Know that the Minotaurs of Balthazar Lair hold you in the highest regard. You will always be welcome among us.;;;;
942;Excellent!  Now that the Ogres are cleared from the roads and no longer inhabit the fortress, the roads to Ravenshore, Ironsand and Murmurwoods are safe again!  ;;;;
