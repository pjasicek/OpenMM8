6	item006	Two-Handed Sword	400	Weapon2	Sword	4d5	0	8	1	Two-Handed Sword	2	0	0	16	162	This blade's great weight and length give its blows greater reach and damage. Otherwise, it is unexceptional in quality.

19	item019	Regnan Falchion	750	Weapon	Sword	2d4	8	7	9	Cutlass	4	0	0	18	143	The extremely forward balance of this weapon's blade gives it extra striking power, but requires great strength and skill from its wielder.

21	item021	Crude Dagger	8	Weapon	Dagger	2d2	0	6	1	Dagger	5	0	0	16	77	As much a cutting tool and eating implement as a weapon, this dagger of soft steel will take an edge, but will lose it through very little use.

23	item023	Merchantman's Dagger	150	Weapon	Dagger	2d2	3	6	4	Dagger	5	0	0	14	80	This dagger is a typical example of those produced by the weaponsmiths of Alvar. It is made of hardened steel and has excellent balance.
24	item024	Master's Dagger	250	Weapon	Dagger	2d2	5	6	6	Dagger	5	0	0	19	80	Daggers of this quality are rare indeed. Made of erudine and rare woods, finished in gold, and set with a sizable ruby, this would be a rich man's extravagance if it were not also so effective a weapon.
25	item025	Fanged Blade	300	Weapon	Dagger	2d2	6	6	9	Dagger	5	0	0	20	45	The grip on this blade has clearly been rewrapped many times. It is said that such blades were used by the first Vampires who appeared millennia before the Silence. Could this possibly be one of those ancient weapons?

35	item035	Minotaur Battleaxe	775	Weapon	Axe	4d2	11	5	9	Axe	7	0	0	41	110	Forged by the Minotaurs for their wars with the Ogres, these axes are forged of a secret alloy formula. Their edges are difficult to dull and even harder to sharpen.
36	item036	Two-Handed Axe	225	Weapon2	Axe	3d7	0	6	1	Two-Handed Axe	8	0	0	40	92	As much an implement for working wood as a weapon, this crude axe can still deliver a telling blow.

43	item043	Elven Long Spear	250	Weapon1or2	Spear	1d9	5	6	6	Spear	9	0	0	13	119	The fine craftsmanship and balance of this alloy steel headed spear mark it as the work of the weaponsmiths of Alvar.
44	item044	War Spear	450	Weapon1or2	Spear	1d9	9	6	9	Spear	9	0	0	25	124	This spear is built for battle. Far to heavy to be wielded by the part-time militiaman, it is built for the professional warrior who prefers the spear to other weapons.

51	item051	Hayfork	100	Weapon1or2	Spear	2d6	0	6	1	Trident	11	0	0	25	113	Though a common farming implement, this hayfork is of sturdy construction and could be an excellent, if improvised, weapon.

The second is a sense that the dragon turtle bone tines seem to seek vulnerabilities in their targets' defenses as if guided by an unseen hand.
56	item056	Hunting Bow	200	Missile	Bow	5d2	0	6	1	Bow	12	0	0	23	96	These lightweight bows of simple construction are meant for bringing down small game animals - not for direct combat.

60	item060	Devilbone Bow	750	Missile	Bow	5d2	7	3	12	Bow	12	0	0	30	100	Dark Elven bowsmiths have discovered that unusual characteristics of the Kreegan spinal column make it the best material for heavy bowstaves. A clever arrangement of composite pulleys make it possible for those of less than superhuman strength to pull these mighty weapons.
61	item061	Light Crossbow	50	Missile	Bow	4d2	0	4	1	Crossbow	13	0	0	28	70	Because of their ease of use, crossbows like these are stockpiled in militia armories everywhere. Their low pull strength and mediocre workmanship however, make them only moderately effective.
62	item062	Blood Drop Crossbow	200	Missile	Bow	4d2	3	4	3	Crossbow	13	0	0	26	75	A light crossbow of good quality, these weapons feature a grooved table, basic sights and a smooth releasing nut.

65	item065	Regnan Crossbow	550	Missile	Bow	4d2	8	4	12	Crossbow	13	0	0	37	92	The pirates of Regna Island have spent centuries perfecting their crossbow design. The resulting weapon has a crystal lensed sight and bowstaves of pure stalt - which would make the bow impossible to cock if not for the crank draw of erudine alloy.
66	item066	Mace	50	Weapon	Mace	2d4	0	6	1	Mace	14	0	0	22	116	A slight improvement over the common club, maces are better balanced, more durable, and deliver greater damage.
67	item067	Flail	150	Weapon	Mace	2d4	2	6	3	Flail	14	0	0	58	113	Though evolved from the farm implement which shares its name, the flail's great reach and striking power make it a fearsome weapon.
68	item068	Temple Mace	300	Weapon	Mace	2d4	5	6	6	Mace	14	0	0	33	126	"The sunray corona circling the head of this well made mace serves as a devotional declaration for Temple of the Sun clerics; it also greatly increases the damage of its blows. "

This brutal weapon forged as a single piece of stalt alloy is the finest example of their craft.
71	item071	Sledgehammer	120	Weapon	Mace	2d5	0	6	1	Hammer	15	0	0	26	76	This hammer is more a construction tool than a weapon. Still, it could deliver a telling, if clumsy, blow.
72	item072	Field Hammer	300	Weapon	Mace	2d5	3	6	3	Hammer	15	0	0	21	107	This hammer was designed as secondary infantry arm designed to finish off armored opponents who have fallen to the ground.

74	item074	Sun Hammer	650	Weapon	Mace	2d5	9	6	8	Hammer	15	0	0	19	107	Clerics of the Sun are prohibited from using bladed weapons. That they carry such fine warhammers is the natural result of this restriction. As an added measure of devotion, a reverse image of their sun symbol is embossed on the striking face.
75	item075	Trollish Maul	890	Weapon	Mace	2d5	12	6	12	Hammer	15	0	0	31	107	It is necessary to handle this weapon to appreciate its perfect grip and balance.

76	item076	Club	1	Weapon	Club	1d3	0	3	0	Club	16	0	0	16	119	A wooden head and handle studded with short iron spikes, the simple club's best attribute is that it can be constructed from found materials.

Legend says the Blade of Light, Elsenrail, and the Blade of Dark, Glomenthal, will play major roles in the last act of the universe.
501	item296	Glomenthal	20000	Weapon	Sword	3d3	14	Artifact	20	Longsword	1	0	0	29	159	(Might +40, 10-20 points of Dark damage) The Forge of Chaos was destroyed in the making of the Swords of Balance. Legend says the Blade of Light, Elsenrail, and the Blade of Dark, Glomenthal, will play major roles in the last act of the universe.
502	item236	Terminus	15000	Weapon	Sword	3d4	14	Artifact	20	Broadsword	3	0	0	22	141	(Armsmaster skill +7, Air Resistance +30) As a child, before he carved his barbarian kingdom in Vori, Lars Eilief found this sword deep in an ice cave. When he died, it was set adrift with him on his funeral barge. How it ended up in Jadame is a mystery.
503	item237	Judicious Measure	20000	Weapon	Sword	2d4	13	Artifact	20	Cutlass	4	0	0	33	136	(Endurance +40, Luck +40, Ogre Slaying) Before there was a Regnan Empire, the ancestors of the Trolls of Ironsand lived on Regna Island. With this blade and a horde of sea raiders, Hareck I ousted the Trolls and formed his pirate nation.
504	item240	Elderaxe	20000	Weapon	Axe	4d2	12	Artifact	20	Axe	7	0	0	43	129	(Might +20, Swift, 6-12 points of Cold damage, Minotaur) When the Dark Dwarves carved the first Minotaur labyrinth into the heart of Mt. Ashenbane they forged this axe for Xaxius, the first herdmaster.
505	item241	Volcano	15000	Weapon2	Axe	3d7	15	Artifact	20	Two-Handed Axe	8	0	0	43	157	"(10-20 points of Fire damage, Fire Resistance +40) The mad artificer, Cornelius of Blackshire, built this axe for the purpose of clearing the trees around his country estate. ""A single blow will both fell a tree and render it into firewood!"" he was heard to exclaim. That he was soon found slain and the axe gone missing is proof that someone saw a better use for the tool."
506	item045	Wyrm Spitter	20000	Weapon1or2	Spear	1d9	14	Artifact	20	Spear	9	0	0	17	141	(Endurance +20, Dragon Slaying, Swift) Arguably the best dragon hunter of all times, Sir Ryan Smedly carried this mighty spear with him on all his expeditions, claiming that with it in hand, he could best any dragon in single combat. This proved true, but nevertheless he was slain by no less than a dozen dragons who ambushed him at Shadowmarsh Pass.
507	item243	Guardian	15000	Weapon1or2	Spear	3d6	15	Artifact	20	Halberd	10	0	0	48	160	(+10 to all attributes, 10-20 points of Body damage) The great Vampire, Korbu was known to use living men to guard his crypt during daylight hours. Compelled by a spell of enslavement, these sorry souls would walk their rounds carrying these mighty halberds. When Korbu mysteriously vanished, and the slave spell failed, a few of these weapons appeared in the larger world.
508	item239	Foulfang	20000	Weapon	Dagger	2d3	10	Artifact	20	Long Dagger	6	0	0	20	94	(Vampiric, 10 points of Poison damage, Vampire) At the conclusion of the Vampires' War of the Chalice, Korbu exacted horrific retribution on his defeated enemy, Calden Fain. It is better for the world that knowledge of the necromantic arts which rendered Fain--body and soul--into this living blade, is lost.
509	item249	Scepter of Kings	20000	Weapon	Mace	2d4	14	Artifact	20	Mace	14	0	0	20	95	"(Personality + 40, Regenerate Hit Points) Uri Hossana, King of the Western Elves, also called ""The Drunken King,"" was deposed the day he carelessly misplaced his scepter of office while on a hunting trip. This proved to be the last blunder of an incapable ruler. His advisors relieved him of his crown and left him to fend for himself in the Howling Marsh. He was never seen again."
510	item247	Breaker	20000	Weapon	Mace	3d3	12	Artifact	20	Club	16	0	0	36	187	(Might +20, Endurance +20, 10-20 points of Body damage) Trollish folklore is full of the fables of Sevenstrong Burlfist who with Biter, his faithful wolf companion, and his mighty club, Breaker, endlessly quested for the Silver Rose. Fables? One must wonder, if Breaker exists, then why not too, the Silver Rose?
511	item250	Staff of the Swamp	20000	Weapon2	Staff	3d4	10	Artifact	20	Staff	17	0	0	31	113	"(of Shielding; Immune to disease, paralysis, and poison) Nemerit, an otherwise unremarkable witch of the last era, was renown for her staff artificing skill. She created a staff for every conceivable use. It is said she carried this staff on reagent collecting trips into the swamplands."
512	item245	Longseeker	20000	Missile	Bow	5d2	10	Artifact	20	Bow	12	0	0	26	101	(Accuracy +50, Swift, Bow skill +4) Legends tell of many great archer heroes, but none greater than Brennan Morland of whom it was said once pierced a gold sovereign at 300 paces in an archery tournament. Now, holding his bow you must wonder if the legend owes more to the bow than the man.
513	item251	Serendine's Preservation	20000	Armor	Leather	4	30	Artifact	20	Leather Armor	20	0	0	0	0	(Regenerates Spell Points, Endurance +30) A mage known as much for frailty of body as for magical prowess, Serendine of Freehaven built this armor to make the most of his strengths and the least of his weaknesses.
514	item252	Glomenmail	20000	Armor	Chain	8	40	Artifact	20	Chainmail	21	0	0	0	0	(+10 to all statistics, +10 to all resistances, Dark Elf) Dark and Light Elven dealings have been peaceable, if uneasy, for centuries. Before that there was nothing but war. Few suits of this Dark Elven war armor have survived the ravages of time. Those that have are understandably, coveted.
515	item253	Supreme Plate	20000	Armor	Plate	20	50	Artifact	20	Plate Armor	22	0	0	0	0	(Swift, +15 Speed, +15 Accuracy, Knight) Each grandmaster of the Blackshire Armorers' Guild creates a masterpiece suit of plate as proof of his right to hold his station. It is not unusual for a guild member to spend ten to twenty years in the creation of one of these suits.
516	item254	Eclipse	0	Shield	Shield	6	15	Artifact	20	Large Shield	23	0	0	38	73	Quest Item: (of Spirit, of Body, of Mind, Cleric) When the First Temple of the Sun was burned in the War of Dove and Crow fought between the Sun and Moon temples, the holy altar was melted. The altar's metal was later collected and incorporated into this shield carried by Sun Priest Derico during his final deciding campaign of the war.
517	item261	Fleetfingers	20000	Gauntlets	Misc	3	0	Artifact	20	Gauntlets	30	0	0	0	0	(+8 to Disarm Trap, Bow, and Armsmaster skills) That she would actually have a name for her gloves, is evidence of the flamboyant, if deserved, conceit of Darcie Darby--most widely known for her theft of the bejeweled Rod of Right, part of the royal regalia of Enroth.
518	item262	Herald's Boots	20000	Boots	Misc	2	8	Artifact	20	Boots	31	0	0	0	0	(Speed + 30, Swift, Immunity to Sleep) When Jerico Ironfist secured the throne in the First War of Enrothian Succession, he sent forth heralds to spread the news. They were given pairs of these boots so the news would be spread quickly and thus soonest end widespread civil unrest.
519	item140	Ring of Planes	20000	Ring	Misc	0	0	Artifact	20	Ring	32	0	0	0	0	(+40 to Fire, Earth, Water and Air resistances) When the cartographer Alvia Morrania went to chart the terrain of the elemental planes she went well prepared. This ring of general protection was among the many special items commissioned by the Enrothian courts in support of her expedition.
520	item256	Drogg's Helm	20000	Helm	Misc	2	10	Artifact	20	Helm	25	0	0	0	0	(Personality +15, Intellect +15, Regenerates Hit Points) In the history of the barbarian tribes of Vori, it is rare to find a long reigning chieftain. Rarer still is one who held his position through magic rather than might. Drogg was such--a warrior mage who survived many years of rival challenges. It is said that he wore his helmet, even in sleep. Now that you possess it, you understand why.
521	item258	Crown of Final Dominion	20000	Helm	Misc	0	0	Artifact	30	Crown	27	0	0	0	0	(Intellect +50, of Dark Magic, Lich) So named by its creator and only sovereign wearer, Mederon, the first and last Lich Emperor of Nighon. The everlasting dynasty he hoped to found lasted barely a dozen years. Mederon escaped the fate of his kingdom. It is said he still lives as a madman and searches the world for his lost crown.
522	item260	Archangel Wings	20000	Cloak	Misc	1	9	Artifact	20	Cloak	29	0	0	0	0	(Feather Falling, Intellect + 30, All magic resistances + 10) When Angels fall from grace, they lose their wings. Since this is an event of extreme infrequency, angel wings are a very rare commodity. Archangel wings are almost never seen. When used as a material, they imbue the resulting item with fantastic powers.
523	item234	Snake	30000	Weapon	Sword	3d4	12	Relic	30	Longsword	1	0	0	23	169	(Slows target, Water Resistance -50, Personality -15) The pommel of this sword is gruesomely butted by a shrunken medusa's head. Though greatly diminished, the medusa's power flows along Snake's blade and into its targets--a good design, but poorly implemented, for some of the negative energies flow into the sword's wielder as well.
524	item004	Havoc	30000	Weapon	Sword	3d3	15	Relic	30	Longsword	1	0	0	15	136	(Speed +70, Accuracy +70, Armor Class -20) Havoc's enchantment makes it able to readily defeat any target's defenses. Unfortunately, its aggressive spirit makes it indifferent to parrying movements.
525	item010	Finality	30000	Weapon2	Sword	4d5	15	Relic	30	Two-Handed Sword	2	0	0	17	161	(10-20 points of Fire damage, Slow, Speed -20) When the arch assassin, Demetri Razen was finally brought to justice, it was found that his skin was granted unusual hardness by a permanent enchantment. Normal blades would not cut him, so Finality was forged to deliver the death blow sentenced by the Enrothian courts. 
526	item248	Hell's Cleaver	30000	Weapon	Axe	4d2	12	Relic	30	Axe	7	0	0	24	124	"(Might + 70, Accuracy +70, Personality -50, Intellect -50) So called because of its power to demonize its wielder, nevertheless, there are many who would willingly pay the price for the power offered by ""Hell's Cleaver."""
527	item242	Spiritslayer	30000	Weapon1or2	Spear	1d9	13	Relic	30	Spear	9	0	0	17	124	(Vampiric, Might +50, Luck -40) Many under the rule of Luthiner the Severe saw the existence of his spear Spiritslayer as proof of the existence of evil. The injuries caused by the spear go beyond the physical as Spiritslayer takes a strike as an opportunity to drink its target's very essence.
528	item244	Trident of Rulership	30000	Weapon1or2	Spear	2d6	13	Relic	30	Spear	9	0	0	20	133	(Water Breathing, +70 Water Resistance, -70 Fire Resistance) The Trident of Rulership was never meant to be on dry land, yet when the once mighty, ocean to ocean, Triton empire collapsed, many of its greatest artifacts including those of its royal treasure were looted and made their way to the surface.
529	item238	Blade of Mercy	30000	Weapon	Dagger	2d2	15	Relic	30	Dagger	5	0	0	17	84	(Might +40, 4-10 points Electrical damage, Accuracy -40, Necromancer) Though generally considered unfashionable among current necromantic customs, live sacrifice was once widely practiced. To reduce the cruelty inflicted on his victims, the Necromancer Ferredine the Merciful created a blade capable of bringing about a quicker and less suffered end.
530	item083	Staff of Elements	30000	Weapon2	Staff	2d4	4	Relic	30	Staff	17	0	0	34	108	(of Air Magic, of Fire Magic, of Water Magic, of Earth Magic, -40 Armor Class) By imposing upon its wielder a deepened state of concentration, the Staff of Elements increases his or her affinity with elemental magic to a profound degree. Of course, it is not always a good thing to have one's attention taken away from one's immediate concerns.
531	item059	Tournament Bow	30000	Missile	Bow	5d2	10	Relic	30	Bow	12	0	0	19	87	(Accuracy +100, Bow skill + 5, Armor Class -20) This bow was built to the specifications of the great Elven tournament archer, Terin Tourfeather. More concerned with fancy shooting than with the realities of the battlefield, the bow's detrimental effects were of no concern to Tourfeather--more workaday wielders should pay more heed.
532	item246	Lightning Crossbow	30000	Missile	Bow	4d2	12	Relic	30	Crossbow	13	0	0	36	87	(Swift, Accuracy -50, Dark Elf) An ingenious combination of the mechanical and magical went into the creation of this self-cocking crossbow which launches its quarrels with incredible force. That the same launching force causes it to kick like a mule means only the most skilled can use it to any good effect.
533	item251	Last Stage Cuirass	30000	Armor	Leather	4	15	Relic	30	Leather Armor	20	0	0	0	0	(Personality +80, Intellect +70, -30 Mind and Spirit resistances) The final stage of degeneration from their human form leaves a Lich completely soulless and thus immune to certain magics. Such liches often curse their personal items with vulnerabilities to these magics to dissuade others from using them.
534	item255	Herondale's Lost Shield	30000	Shield	Shield	4	10	Relic	30	Small Shield	24	0	0	61	52	"(Immune to Fear, Stone, Paralysis, and Sleep; Personality -15, Luck -15) The great knight Gerrald Herondale abandoned this shield after it took the brunt of a dark and deadly curse. Though it still retained its great powers, the shield was also weighed down with malevolent energies."
535	item141	Ring of Fusion	30000	Ring	Misc	0	0	Relic	30	Ring	32	0	0	0	0	(of Water, Alchemy skill + 5, Intellect +40, Endurance -20) A lost relic of the Freehaven Alchemists' Guild, until its disappearance, this ring was the signet of the guildmaster. It was meant to be worn only during the mixing of the most powerful potions for it drew much energy from the user.
536	item115	Lucky Hat	30000	Helm	Misc	0	0	Relic	30	Hat	26	0	0	0	0	(Luck + 90, Personality -50) The only reason someone would wear this hat is for the luck it conveys. It is the farthest thing from flattering!
537	item121	Berserker Belt	30000	Belt	Misc	0	0	Relic	30	Belt	28	0	0	0	0	"(Might +100, Immune to Fear, Accuracy -30, Armor Class -15) An experiment of the Blackshire Artificers' Guild, this belt was designed to turn its wearer into the perfect warrior--mighty and fearless. No more were made when in field tests it became apparent that ""foolhardy"" and ""careless"" were not virtues of the perfect warrior."
538	item068	Mace of the Sun	12000	Weapon	Mace	3d4	7	Special	0	Mace	14	Elemental Slaying	0	33	124	Though at first it appears to be the same type of mace carried by Sun Temple clerics everywhere, this item seems to thrum with conflicting energies.
539	item045	Ebonest	0	Weapon1or2	Spear	2d9	13	Special	0	Spear	9	Dragon Slaying	0	17	139	Quest Item: Charles Quixote's personal spear of Dragon slaying, Ebonest is a fine weapon indeed. When used against a Dragon, it seems to aim unerringly for the chinks between its target's tough scales.
540	item010	Sword of Whistlebone	0	Weapon2	Sword	4d5	12	Special	0	Two-Handed Sword	2	Dragon Slaying	0	17	159	Quest Item: That the Whistlebones would settle upon such a fierce weapon for their heirloom speaks much of their commitment to the family business of Dragon hunting.
541	item040	Axe of Balthazar	0	Weapon2	Axe	3d7	15	Special	0	Two-Handed Axe	8	of Ice	0	41	110	"Quest Item: No Minotaur kings wear a crown. Instead as their badge of office they carry great axes of the finest workmanship. This axe was lost when Balthazar was betrayed by the Vori Frost Giants. That it is strongly enchanted is clear; when used in battle its blows deliver both normal damage and impart a numbing bite of freezing cold."
542	item060	Noblebone Bow	15000	Missile	Bow	5d4	12	Special	30	Bow	12	of Carnage	0	30	100	"Bows of Kreegan bone are highly sought after; the material is strong and takes enchantments easily. The most sought after bone comes from Kreegans of the devil race's former ruling class."
